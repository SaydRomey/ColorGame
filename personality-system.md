🔄 PERSONALITY IN WORLD INTERACTION

NPC dialogue branches:
“A warrior like you (Red) wouldn’t care about treaties.”
“You smell like tree bark and old songs (Green). I’ll trust you.”

Factions may favor or fear you based on your dominant hue:

Blue-aligned character in a Red faction may be seen as a “calculating snake”

Yellow in a Brown zone may be seen as naive or a trickster


Final choices and ending tone shift subtly depending on your long-term hue alignment — affecting music, dialogue, and even animation tone.
