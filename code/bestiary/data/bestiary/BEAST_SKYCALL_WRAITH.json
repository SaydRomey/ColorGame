    "name": "Skycall Wraith",
    "type": "Aerial Apparition / Wind-echo Specter",
    "threat_level": "⚠️ Moderate – Highly Disruptive to Traversal",
    "first_emerged": "After the Collapse of the Singing Gate (Shattering Era)",
    "description": "Cloaked in torn azure robes that never touch the ground.\n\nEmits shrieking gusts that cancel gliding and distort sound-based abilities.\n\nEach wraith floats with erratic grace — as if moved by voices only it can hear.",
    "hue_interaction": "- Dampens all Cobalt-based traversal effects nearby (e.g., Static Dash glide extensions).\n- Cries override sound-triggered puzzle inputs.\n- Vulnerable to grounded or Earth-based counterweights, which temporarily still their flight.",
    "behavior": "- Patrol wind tunnels, cliff ledges, or broken sky bridges.\n- When provoked, emits a Disruption Cry that cancels flight/glide, disorients sound-based UI cues, and at high stacks triggers a “Vertigo Pulse.”\n- Will flee into fog if surrounded by silence (e.g., Cerulean Cloak active).",
    "weaknesses": "- Weak to Earthen grounding spells, sound-null zones, or double-jump rhythm breaks.\n- Silence interrupts their shriek cycle.\n- Mind Echo can “overwrite” their cry with a stored sound (especially a player’s own voice).",
    "notes": "Some wraiths seem drawn to names — especially those carved or whispered.\nRumors tell of a Skycall Wraith that hums a lullaby from before the Shattering… but always off-key."
