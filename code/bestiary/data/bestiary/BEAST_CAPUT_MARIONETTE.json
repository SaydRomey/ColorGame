    "name": "Caput Marionette",
    "type": "Alchemical Undead / Ritual Construct",
    "threat_level": "⚠️ Moderate – Area-dependent hazard",
    "first_emerged": "During the Phylactery Rebellion, Year of the Dull Moon",
    "description": "Caput Marionettes are abandoned constructs — partially animated corpses intended for soul transfer tests. Left unfinished, they wander memory halls and ruined labs, seeking the rituals they were meant to complete.",
    "hue_interaction": "Resistant to Brown (Earthen) decay effects — they are already ruined.\n\nWeak to Violet illusions and Crimson direct damage.\n\nStabilized briefly by proximity to Caput Mortuum Phylactery relics.",
    "behavior": "Remain inert until the player interacts with specific relics, memory statues, or spirit glyphs.\n\nOn activation, they move with jerky, unnatural rhythm.\n\nUpon death, release a decay cloud that drains equipped memory-bound artifacts unless dispelled.",
    "weaknesses": "Can be defeated preemptively with a Soulward Sigil or truth-spoken name.\n\nVulnerable to illusions — confused by false commands.\n\nParalyzed momentarily by hearing the voice of their original summoner (can be simulated via audio glyphs).",
    "notes": "If purified rather than killed, a Caput Marionette may kneel before the player and whisper a forgotten alchemical recipe. Some whisper in your voice."
