    "threat_level": "⚠️⚠️ Extreme – Area-Denial, Environmental Reshaping",
    "first_emerged": "During the Third Emberwake",
    "description": "A towering giant formed from layered volcanic glass, fused ash, and molten sorrow. Each step reshapes the battlefield, leaving trails of slow-burning ground and erupting embers.",
    "hue_interaction": "Unstable around Vermilion and Burnt Sienna hues. Contact with Crimson-imbued relics may cause it to fracture and enter an enraged state.",
    "behavior": "Patrols volcanic ruins with slow, deliberate movements. Slams the ground to release pyroclastic waves. Periodically collapses, reforming from ash shortly after.",
    "weaknesses": "Vulnerable to resonance-based seismic spells and ancient cooling chants. Fractures under its own rage if baited into overexertion.",
    "notes": "Legends say it was once a mountain-top guardian, mourning a sunken city. Some claim you can still hear bells when it raises its arms — bells from a temple long buried in ash."
