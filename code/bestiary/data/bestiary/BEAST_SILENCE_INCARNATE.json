    "first_emerged": "At the edge of the Core Wound, within stilled air",
    "description": "A floating, faceless figure robed in layered black and voidlight.\nIts eyes — or what pass for them — never shift, never close.\nWhen you move, it does not. But when you stop… it remembers everything.",
    "hue_interaction": "- Nullifies all active hue-based abilities when visible.\n- Can only be misdirected using illusion spells, light-bending terrain, or architectural interference.",
    "behavior": "- Appears near key glyph gates or during silent puzzle segments.\n- Does not pursue, but rotates slowly to follow your last clear movement.\n- If it locks eyes for more than 3 seconds, disables your action inputs until you find cover or line-break.",
    "weaknesses": "- Reflections (like Shatterglass Pools) confuse its targeting briefly.\n- Using Violet’s Glamour Pulse or Yellow’s Lightform Cloak can disrupt its line of sight.\n- Activating certain lore-bound artifacts (e.g., the Bistre Lantern or Isabelline Tapestry) may cause it to recede or glitch.",
    "notes": "Presence fades after completing key puzzle objectives.\nIf ignored too long, the area around it distorts — time slows, UI shimmers, sound vanishes.\nSome players report feeling watched after defeating it."
