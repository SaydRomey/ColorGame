🌈 OPTIONS FOR VISUALIZING BOUND HUES (In-Game Sprite)

🔹 1. Subtle Color Veins / Fractures

Faint glowing cracks or veins appear on their skin, arms, or neck.

Each hue has its own zone:

Green = vines along limbs

Red = pulsing near the heart

Blue = around temples and fingers


If three hues are bound, they can “mix” toward the chest/core.


🔹 2. Prism Core Glow

The crystal shard in their chest glows with the hue(s) currently equipped.

For multiple hues: slow, shifting gradient pulse, or split prism shards orbiting/floating.


🔹 3. Aura or Edge Lighting

Thin outline glow or shimmering particles surrounding them:

Single color = halo or shimmer

Two colors = split left/right or flickering back and forth

Three = rotating prismatic halo (faint to avoid visual clutter)



🔹 4. Color Trails While Moving

Movement leaves a ghost trail in the active hue(s)

Purple leaves dreamy sparkles

Red leaves embers

Yellow flickers like sunlight



🔹 5. Clothing Tint Adaptation

Parts of the cloak adapt: edges, inner lining, or runic symbols shift to match active hues.

Cloak remains mostly gray or desaturated to contrast the added hues.

🌀 Suggestion for HUD/Gameplay Tie-In

Show bound colors as gems or icons orbiting the core shard in the UI.

On interaction or attack, the active hue pulses subtly on the sprite (e.g., arm glows red briefly when attacking with a red-bound skill).
