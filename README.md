### 🧭 1. Faction & Culture Design (World Depth)
- Purpose: Populate the world with societies, customs, beliefs, and conflicts.
- Design 1–2 factions per region (e.g., Crimson Reclaimers in Vireya, Glasswright Guild in Iriseld)
- Establish belief systems, aesthetics, values, and rivalries
- Create color-based etiquette or taboos (e.g., in Luxeran, yellow is sacred and can’t be worn by outsiders)

---

### 🛡️ 2. Combat & Ability System (Gameplay Mechanics)
- Purpose: Define how the player interacts with the world mechanically.
- Develop the color-binding combat system (active/passive powers per hue)
- Create status effects tied to colors (e.g., green = regeneration, red = frenzy, purple = confusion)
- Establish weapon classes or magic schools tied to the color families

---

### 📜 3. Quests & Narrative Arcs (Story Structure)
- Purpose: Add personal, world-scale, and faction-based stories.
- Write main quest outline: Reforging the Prism, dealing with the Tyrian Purge
- Create side quests per region based on faction tensions, lost artifacts, or moral choices
- Add a few twist quests (e.g., NPC is colorless and hiding it)

---

### 🪶 4. Artifact & Item System
- Purpose: Deepen exploration and creativity.
- Finalize each color artifact (you already have great ones!) and add rare variants
- Define crafting/alchemy mechanics based on combining pigments or relics
- Create a color infusion system for gear

---

### 🏙️ 5. Key Locations, Dungeons, Shrines
- Purpose: Build the physical play space and memorable encounters.
- Flesh out major cities and hubs in each region
- Design a color-themed dungeon per biome (e.g., Verdant Labyrinth, Crimson Arena, Blooming Archive)
- Place shrines or Prism Gates that unlock traversal/powers

---

### 📖 6. NPC Roster & Dialogue Trees
- Purpose: Make the world feel alive and reactive.
- Create 1–2 major NPCs per region (e.g., a mentor, a rival, a betrayer)
- Add dialogue variations depending on color-bound status
- Write color-aligned greetings, insults, and lore drops
