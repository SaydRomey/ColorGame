## 🧭 1. Faction & Culture Design (World Depth)

Purpose: Populate the world with societies, customs, beliefs, and conflicts.

Design 1–2 factions per region (e.g., Crimson Reclaimers in Vireya, Glasswright Guild in Iriseld)

Establish belief systems, aesthetics, values, and rivalries

Create color-based etiquette or taboos (e.g., in Luxeran, yellow is sacred and can’t be worn by outsiders)


---

## 🛡️ 2. Combat & Ability System (Gameplay Mechanics)

Purpose: Define how the player interacts with the world mechanically.

Develop the color-binding combat system (active/passive powers per hue)

Create status effects tied to colors (e.g., green = regeneration, red = frenzy, purple = confusion)

Establish weapon classes or magic schools tied to the color families


---

## 📜 3. Quests & Narrative Arcs (Story Structure)

Purpose: Add personal, world-scale, and faction-based stories.

Write main quest outline: Reforging the Prism, dealing with the Tyrian Purge

Create side quests per region based on faction tensions, lost artifacts, or moral choices

Add a few twist quests (e.g., NPC is colorless and hiding it)


---

## 🪶 4. Artifact & Item System

Purpose: Deepen exploration and creativity.

Finalize each color artifact (you already have great ones!) and add rare variants

Define crafting/alchemy mechanics based on combining pigments or relics

Create a color infusion system for gear


---

## 🏙️ 5. Key Locations, Dungeons, Shrines

Purpose: Build the physical play space and memorable encounters.

Flesh out major cities and hubs in each region

Design a color-themed dungeon per biome (e.g., Verdant Labyrinth, Crimson Arena, Blooming Archive)

Place shrines or Prism Gates that unlock traversal/powers


---

## 📖 6. NPC Roster & Dialogue Trees

Purpose: Make the world feel alive and reactive.

Create 1–2 major NPCs per region (e.g., a mentor, a rival, a betrayer)

Add dialogue variations depending on color-bound status

Write color-aligned greetings, insults, and lore drops
