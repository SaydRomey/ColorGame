# The wold

The world (let’s just call it The Realm for now) will be divided into six main biomes/regions, 
each aligned with a color family and designed to support its associated mood, gameplay mechanics, and faction culture.

## 🗺️ WORLD MAP OVERVIEW

Each region has:

- A name
- A dominant biome
- A color family
- A central city or stronghold
- A main artifact/character hook
- Unique mechanics or hazards

## MAP STRUCTURE CONCEPT: “The Realm”

### Design Philosophy

World shaped by the shattering of the Prismatic Core, with shards embedding themselves across the land.  

- **Central hub:** The Colorless Core (**Nullshade**) — the impact crater where the Core exploded  
- **Surrounding regions:** Six major color biomes, each with distinct terrain, architecture, NPCs, hazards, and music
