## 🌿 Enemy Concepts for Huevale – The Verdant Frontier

A realm where nature overgrows memory, 
where alchemy breathes through every bloom 
and the line between life and illusion is blurred by moss and mist.  
Here, plants whisper forgotten names, and the forest dreams half-truths in pollen and sap.

The enemies of Huevale embody its contradictions 
— playful yet predatory, beautiful yet toxic, whimsical yet deeply rooted in decay and rebirth.  
They are nature’s mischief and its mercy, wrapped in petals, thorns, and memory-laced spores.

## ⚫ Enemy Concepts for Nullshade – The Colorless Core

The void where hue was broken, and memory exiled itself to silence.  
Geometry fractures. Time lurches. Voices echo from forgotten futures.  
Here, nothing attacks you directly — it asks you to attack yourself.

Enemies in Nullshade are reflections, contradictions, remnants.  
Some remember you before you entered. Others rewrite you when struck.  
You do not defeat them — you must un-become what they recognize.

> “A hue that forgot what it was.”

<img src="../assets/sprites/enemies/nullshade/prism-unform.png" alt="Prism Unform Sprite" width="200">

Shifting spectral figure that constantly flickers between hues — its form glitches.

> “It doesn’t attack. It remembers you doing so.”

<img src="../assets/sprites/enemies/nullshade/nullshade-echo.png" alt="Nullshade Echo Sprite" width="200">

Ghostly silhouette that replays your past actions — literal echoes of your earlier fights, dialogue choices, or attacks.

Appears again in Nullshade — but broken, flickering, mirroring forgotten possibilities.  
Now exists across multiple points in space 
— each version mutely reacting to different player decisions not taken
