> Important current logical inconsistency: 
> Nullshade is meant to be the origin of the player (birthplace of the Prismwalker), 
> but also a locked late-game zone discovered only after extensive exploration.
> Let’s now fix that narrative contradiction — or rather, reframe it into a mystery.

##  Logical Fix: Nullshade as Forgotten Origin

We don’t need to rewrite the premise 
— we just clarify when the player’s connection to Nullshade is revealed.

## 🧩 Updated Narrative Logic: “The Forgotten Core”

Nullshade is the birthplace of the Prismwalker, but:
- The Prismwalker was never meant to leave.
- Their first emergence into the world caused the Prism to shatter.
- The Orders bound Nullshade behind seals to hide the wound and prevent memory bleed.

The Player begins the game unaware of their true origin.  
Their first memory is from outside Nullshade 
— perhaps awakening near Huevale or Vireya, clutching the Shard.

Only after gaining all six hues and engaging with enough memory echoes across the world 
does the truth begin to surface.

Hints are seeded throughout the regions, such as:
- “Your shard feels familiar here…” (near ancient monoliths)
- “This glyph speaks your name. But older.” (spoken by an enemy or artifact)
- “They sealed what birthed you — and called it a mercy.” (Bistre Archivist, perhaps)

Nullshade only unlocks after the Hue Archive is nearly complete, 
and the player reaches a critical moment 
— for example, after defeating a penultimate boss, 
they dream of the Prism Wound and awaken with the map changed.

## Final twist:

The Prismwalker wasn’t just born in Nullshade.

They were part of the Core itself — a vessel grown in secret, 
meant to unify the hues… until they fled or were cast out.

Nullshade is not just the end.  
It’s a return to what you were before you were a “you.”

## Optional Scene: Unlocking the Memory

Location: The last completed Glyph Fountain or Archive Fragment

> The shard in your hand glows — not in color, but in absence.
> “This path… it was once the only path.”
> A shadow pulls your gaze toward a gray fracture on the map.  
> It wasn’t there before.
> Nullshade awakens.

With this fix, we now preserve:
- Nullshade as a sealed, endgame region
- The Prismwalker’s true origin
- A compelling mystery-reveal arc
- A final choice with deep personal and metaphysical stakes
