# 🌊 Iriseld – *The Tidespire Reach (Blue)*

> “Suspended between storm and sky, Iriseld is a place where grief rides the wind 
> and truth flickers like lightning over distant waves.”

A realm of floating islands, refracted storms, and illusion-bound skyglass.  
The air carries memories, songs, and gravity distortions.  
Rain falls upward. Music forms bridges.  
Colors here shimmer with regret, clarity, and fragile beauty.
