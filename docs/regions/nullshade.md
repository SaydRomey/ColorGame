  </br><i>The Forgotten Womb of the Core</i></br>

**Nullshade Ruins** is the place between realms 
‚Äî the aftermath of a war the world forgot.  
It is lifeless but not dead. 
Everything here feels paused, as if time avoids this place.

### Environmental Storytelling & Design

> ‚ÄúWhere color was first stripped‚Ä¶ 
> and where the last breath of the Prism still echoes.‚Äù

### Color Palette:
Desaturated grays, broken whites, void-tones.  

Occasionally, glimmers of color flicker unnaturally 
‚Äî like light through oil on water ‚Äî but they fade when approached.  

### Sound Design:
Muffled wind, distant crystalline chimes, reversed echoes, and "silent thunder" 
‚Äî the sound of a memory trying to resurface.

## Key Visual Features

### Collapsed Monoliths
- Once radiant towers from the Prism Age.
- Now cracked and hollow, leeching any nearby hue into the soil.
- Some still *hum faintly* if touched by The Prismwalker.

### Shatterglass Pools
- Pools of liquid crystal reflecting **memories not your own.**
- Occasionally show glimpses of the world as it was ‚Äî or as it might be.
- Standing near them causes Prismwalker‚Äôs shard to glow faintly.

### Stone Figures / ‚ÄúThe Bound‚Äù
- Scattered throughout are frozen, featureless statues ‚Äî some mid-movement, some kneeling.
- They are echoes of those who once tried to contain or reject color entirely.
- Whispering can be heard near them. Occasionally, they move when unseen.

### The Core Wound
- The central crater where the Prism exploded.
- The environment distorts here ‚Äî angles warp, gravity shifts subtly, and sound falls away completely.
- The Prismwalker awakens here ‚Äî their body inert, only the shard beating.

## Environmental Narrative Themes

### Loss of memory as architecture:
Structures that seem impossible, 
as if they were designed by forgotten physics or logic.

### Identity mirrors:
Scattered fragments show you not as you are, 
but as the world once feared or hoped you‚Äôd become.

### Hollow divinity:
Altars to the Core, untouched for centuries, now cracked and empty.
