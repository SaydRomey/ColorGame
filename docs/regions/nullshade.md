## 🌑 NULLSHADE RUINS — The Forgotten Womb of the Core

### 🎨 Environmental Storytelling & Design

> “Where color was first stripped… and where the last breath of the Prism still echoes.”

#### 🧭 Overview

Nullshade Ruins is the place between realms — the aftermath of a war the world forgot. It is lifeless but not dead. Everything here feels paused, as if time avoids this place.

- Color Palette: Desaturated grays, broken whites, void-tones. Occasionally, glimmers of color flicker unnaturally — like light through oil on water — but they fade when approached.

- Sound Design: Muffled wind, distant crystalline chimes, reversed echoes, and "silent thunder" — the sound of a memory trying to resurface.

### 🧱 Key Visual Features

#### 🪨 Collapsed Monoliths

- Once radiant towers from the Prism Age.

- Now cracked and hollow, leeching any nearby hue into the soil.

- Some still *hum faintly* if touched by The Prismwalker.

#### 💠 Shatterglass Pools

- Pools of liquid crystal reflecting **memories not your own.**

- Occasionally show glimpses of the world as it was — or as it might be.

- Standing near them causes Prismwalker’s shard to glow faintly.

#### 🧍 Stone Figures / “The Bound”

- Scattered throughout are frozen, featureless statues — some mid-movement, some kneeling.

They are echoes of those who once tried to contain or reject color entirely.

Whispering can be heard near them. Occasionally, they move when unseen.

#### 🌀 The Core Wound

- The central crater where the Prism exploded.

- The environment distorts here — angles warp, gravity shifts subtly, and sound falls away completely.

- The Prismwalker awakens here — their body inert, only the shard beating.

### 📖 Environmental Narrative Themes

- Loss of memory as architecture: Structures that seem impossible, as if they were designed by forgotten physics or logic.

- Identity mirrors: Scattered fragments show you not as you are, but as the world once feared or hoped you’d become.

- Hollow divinity: Altars to the Core, untouched for centuries, now cracked and empty.
