# 🌐 REVISED WORLD LAYOUT – 7 Primary Realms

Updated layout design and logical progression path, especially reconciling:
- Nullshade’s “starting point” paradox
- Mid/late-game unlock gates
- Cross-region color dependencies (puzzles, items, etc.)
- Narrative flow (NPC arcs, Orders, hue mastery)

---

## ⭕ Nullshade – The Colorless Core (⚫)
- Location: Geographical center of the map, surrounded by fractured radial terrain
- Access: Locked at start; revealed later via memory shards and hue unification
- Narrative Role: Both origin and end of the Prismwalker — revealed via echo-choice flashbacks
- Key Landmarks:
  - Prism Wound (final boss arena)
  - Shatterglass Pools
  - Core Wound
  - Memory Gate Circles
  - The Bound Grove (statue field)
- Enemies: All 12 Nullshade entries (including The Seventh Hue)
- SNPCs: None truly alive. Echoes of Tapestry Watcher, The Prismwalker’s former selves, and Whispering Shards.

> 📌 Logic Fix: 
> Player awakens in a color-suppressed memory of Nullshade — a dreamlike echo —
> and is then expelled outward into one of the outer realms based on early dialogue input.
