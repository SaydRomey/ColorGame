## 📜 TIMELINE: The Fall of the Prismatic Core


### 🕊️ Age of Light – The Unified Hue

> “In the beginning, all color was one.”


The world was once balanced by a single entity: **the Prismatic Core**, 
a divine crystal pulsing with all hues in harmony.

From it, the world emerged vibrant and whole — color wasn't just beauty; it was language, law, magic, and life.

Each color was a facet of existence, and those attuned to it could shape the world around them.

The Prismara, a collective of color-bonded sages, kept harmony between realms.

### 🔮 Age of Echoes – Rise of the Color Orders

Over centuries, color-users began to specialize.  
The Prismara fractured into six color Orders, each choosing a dominant hue and a different truth:

- 🌿 **Verdant Order (Greens):** Growth, nature, alchemy, memory through roots and bloom.
- 🔥 **Crimson Order (Reds):** Passion, fire, blood, glory — forged in war and ritual.
- 🌊 **Cobalt Order (Blues):** Intellect, spirit, stillness and storm.
- 🟪 **Violet Order (Purples):** Dreams, illusion, selfhood — the realm of identity.
- ☀️ **Aurelian Order (Yellows/Oranges):** Light, fortune, vitality — seers and sunbinders.
- 🪨 **Earthen Order (Browns/Neutrals):** Decay, history, transmutation — chroniclers of endings.

Though loosely allied under the Prismara banner, the Orders grew apart.  
They hoarded relics, refined hue-specific spellcraft, and shaped the land around their essence.

Minor color skirmishes flared, but the Prismara kept the balance.

### ⚔️ Age of Bloom and Rust – The Color War

> “Too much red, and even roses become swords.”

The Tyrian Dynasty, a royal faction blending Crimson and Violet, sought dominion through monochromatic unification — enslaving the Core itself to fuel a hue-pure empire.  
They ignited the Color War, a century of violent chromatic conflict.

As battles bled across the land, colors began to twist and corrupt each other.

The Nullshade Plague emerged — a colorless, consuming void infecting places and people, 
erasing memory, identity, even time.

#### Notable events and fallouts:

Emergence of Nullshade Plague — a spreading void that erases memory, hue, and form.

The Crimson Crusades and Verdant Suppression War tore through their homelands, scarring the natural and spiritual fabric.

The Molten Shardfall birthed beasts like the Glasslash Serpent, and banners burned until Bannerbound Revenants rose.


The Tyrians nearly succeeded — until a rogue Prismara, possibly Amaranth or their apprentice, shattered the Prismatic Core in a final act of rebellion.

### 💥 The Shattering – Birth of the Realms

> “It didn’t break evenly. It bled.”

The Core’s rupture triggered the Huefall — a burst of raw chromatic energy that sundered continents and souls.  
Each hue fled into isolation, birthing distorted biomes: color-choked forests, flame-locked highlands, lightless hollows.

Entire beings were rewritten or undone — giving rise to Nullborn Husks, Color Echoes, and Unmade Shrines.

Magic became unstable. Hue now requires binding through relics, rituals, or deep emotional resonance.

The Orders splintered, some collapsing, others becoming secretive archives or cults.
The Tyrian Dynasty vanished — presumed destroyed… or sealed in Nullshade.

Magic became unstable, and color use now required binding to relics or sacred artifacts.

### 🌑 Current Era – The Dimming Cycle

> “You are born without color, and must earn your hue.”

The world lies shattered into Hue Realms, each dominated by its own chromatic law:

🌿 Huevale pulses with alchemical memory — vines dream in green.

🔥 Vireya burns with history and rage — every duel a page in ash.

🌊 Iriseld drowns in reflection and storm (pending).

And more fractured domains lurk in twilight

Color cults, scavenger-warlocks, and Null-touched creatures roam unchecked.  
Some seek to revive the Prismara. Others wish to burn it all.

---

A colorless figure — the Prismwalker — has appeared. They can wield any hue… but not without cost.

Some call them the Core’s heir.
Others, the last mistake of a dying light.

The question remains:

> “Will you reforge the Prism? Or let color die screaming?”

The goal is whispered in every tongue: 
Reforge the Prism, or let the hues burn themselves out forever.
