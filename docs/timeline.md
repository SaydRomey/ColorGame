## 📜 TIMELINE: The Fall of the Prismatic Core


### 🕊️ Age of Light – The Unified Hue

> “In the beginning, all color was one.”


The world was once balanced by a single entity: **the Prismatic Core**, 
a divine crystal pulsing with all hues in harmony.\
From it, the world emerged vibrant and whole — color wasn't just beauty; it was language, law, magic, and life.\
Each color was a facet of existence, and those attuned to it could shape the world around them.\
The Prismara, a collective of color-bonded sages, kept harmony between realms.

### 🔮 Age of Echoes – Rise of the Color Orders

Over centuries, color-users began to specialize. \
The Prismara fractured into six color Orders, each devoted to a specific facet:

- **Verdant Order (Greens):** growth, nature, alchemy  
- **Crimson Order (Reds):** passion, blood, warfare  
- **Cobalt Order (Blues):** intellect, spirit, storms  
- **Violet Order (Purples):** magic, dreams, identity  
- **Aurelian Order (Yellows/Oranges):** light, fortune, vitality  
- **Earthen Order (Browns/Neutrals):** decay, memory, transmutation


While still loosely allied, each Order began to hoard color essence, developing unique magic, cultures, and philosophies.\
Minor color skirmishes flared, but the Prismara kept the balance.

### ⚔️ Age of Bloom and Rust – The Color War

> “Too much red, and even roses become swords.”


An ambitious splinter faction, led by the Tyrian Dynasty, 
attempted to enslave the Core, binding it to their royal bloodline.\
Their goal: monochromatic dominion — a world under one eternal purple-red hue.\
The other Orders resisted, igniting the Color War — a century-long magical conflict.\
As battles bled across the land, colors began to twist and corrupt each other.\
The Nullshade Plague emerged — a colorless, consuming void infecting places and people, 
erasing memory, identity, even time.

### 💥 The Shattering – Birth of the Realms

In a last desperate stand, a rogue Prismara mage shattered the Prismatic Core to stop the Tyrian ritual.\
The explosion ruptured reality, causing a Huefall — every color blasted into physical space, forming isolated biomes.\
The Orders scattered or collapsed. The Tyrian Dynasty was believed extinct… or trapped in Nullshade.\
Magic became unstable, and color use now required binding to relics or sacred artifacts.

### 🌑 Current Era – The Dimming Cycle

> “You are born without color, and must earn your hue.”


The world lies fragmented, each region shaped and ruled by its dominant hue.\
Small factions fight over lost artifacts, while color cults, scavengers, and Null-touched horrors roam freely.\
A colorless being — the Prismwalker — has appeared, able to wield any hue.\
Some see them as the Core’s heir… others as its final mistake.\
The goal is whispered in every tongue: 
Reforge the Prism, or let the hues burn themselves out forever.
