# 📜 TIMELINE: The Fall of the Prismatic Core

> A world once whole, now bleeding in every shade.

<!--

##  Before the Fracture (The Pre-Prismatic Era)

## The Age of Threads
Civilizations were loosely aligned by region, faith, or natural hue affinity.

## The Blooming Peace
Huevale flourishes under the Verdant Order, blending alchemy, memory, and botanical magic.

Vireya’s Crimson Court reigns — a militant alliance of flame-wielders, dancers, and oathbound duelists.

## 🕯️ Age of Light – The Unified Hue

> “In the beginning, all color was one.”


The world was once balanced by a single divine entity: **the Prismatic Core**, 
a radiant crystal pulsing with all hues in harmony.
Color wasn't just beauty — it was law, memory, power, and life.

Each color was a facet of existence.  
Those attuned could shape reality through hue — known as the Prismara, 
a fellowship of sages who walked in unified light.  
For generations, peace held. Color lived in communion.

---

##  Age of Echoes – Rise of the Color Orders

> “A seed cannot help but become a forest.”


Over centuries, color-users began to specialize.  
The Prismara fractured into six Color Orders, 
each choosing a dominant hue and a different truth:

- 🌿 **Verdant Order (Greens):** Growth, nature, alchemy, memory through roots and bloom.
- 🔥 **Crimson Order (Reds):** Passion, fire, blood, glory — forged in war and ritual.
- 🌊 **Cobalt Order (Blues):** Intellect, spirit, stillness and storm.
- 🔮 **Violet Order (Purples):** Dreams, illusion, selfhood — the realm of identity.
- ☀️  **Aurelian Order (Yellows/Oranges):** Light, fortune, vitality — seers and sunbinders.
- 🪨 **Earthen Order (Browns/Neutrals):** Decay, memory, transmutation, entropy — chroniclers of endings.

Though loosely allied under the Prismara banner, the Orders grew apart.  
They hoarded relics, refined hue-specific spellcraft, and shaped the land around their essence.

Minor color skirmishes flared, but the Prismara kept the balance.

---

## ⚔️ Age of Bloom and Rust – The Color War

> “Too much red, and even roses become swords.”


The Tyrian Dynasty, a royal faction blending Crimson and Violet, 
sought dominion through monochromatic unification — enslaving the Core itself to fuel a hue-pure empire.  
They ignited the Color War, a century of violent chromatic conflict.

As battles bled across the land, colors began to twist and corrupt each other.

The Nullshade Plague emerged — a colorless, consuming void infecting places and people, 
erasing memory, identity, even time.

---

### Notable events and fallouts:

- Emergence of **Nullshade Plague** — a spreading void anomaly that devoured hue, memory, and meaning.

- The Crimson Crusades and Verdant Suppression War tore through their homelands, 
scarring the natural and spiritual fabric.
<!-- The Crimson Crusades and Verdant Suppression War tore through ancient groves and fortress-cities. -->

- The Molten Shardfall split the sky over Vireya, birthing horrors like the 
[**Glasslash Serpent**](./enemies/glasslash-serpent.md) and 
[**Ashwrought Colossus**](./enemies/ashwrought-colossus.md).  

- [**Bannerbound Revenants**](./enemies/bannerbound-revenant.md) and 
[**Bloodroot Effigies**](./enemies/bloodroot-effigy.md) haunted battlefields long after banners burned.

- Iriseld’s Skyglass Arena collapsed, its Duelists lost in reflection.  
- Huevale’s groves sang false songs that twisted into traps.  
- Storms wept names no longer remembered.

<!--
The skies fractured above Iriseld; reality thinned in Vireya; entire groves wept in Huevale.
-->

- The Tyrians nearly succeeded — until a rogue Prismara, 
<!-- possibly Amaranth or their apprentice, -->
shattered the Core in a final act of rebellion.

---

## 💥 The Shattering – Birth of the Realms

> “It didn’t break evenly. It bled.”


The Core’s rupture triggered the **Huefall** — a burst of raw chromatic energy that sundered continents and souls.  
Each hue fled into isolation, birthing distorted biomes: color-choked forests, flame-locked highlands, lightless hollows.

<!--
- Forests where roots remember lies.
- Highlands where rage burns time itself.
- Storm-cliffs where grief floats like shattered glass.
- Hollows where dreams walk but no longer know your name.
-->

Color is torn from creatures and objects; memory and form become mutable.  
Entire beings were rewritten or undone: 
- [**Nullborn Husks**](./enemies/nullborn-husks.md) and 
  [**Color Echoes**](./enemies.md#color-echoes) emerged.
- Color rituals grew unstable. Hue now had to be bound — through artifacts, rites, or deep emotional resonance.

The Orders splintered. Some became wandering monasteries. Others dissolved into color cults or resonance-scarred archives.  
The Tyrian Dynasty vanished — presumed destroyed… or sealed in Nullshade.

---


## 🩸 The Post-Shattering Era  – The Wounded World (w.i.p.)

> “The colors survived. But they no longer trusted each other.”


The Verdant Order fragments into secretive archives, 
leaving Huevale overgrown and haunted by memory-rooted beings.

Vireya devolves into Crimson Crusades 
— a thousand personal wars fought over old banners and broken vows.

---

### 🌿 Huevale-Specific Events

- Rise of the Saproot Cult and the corrupted Limerick offshoots.

- Creation of Bloodroot Effigies from the remains of fallen Verdant heroes after the Verdant Suppression War.

- Sporekin begin spreading hallucinogenic pollen, seeding illusion-born entities like the Limeroot Trickster.

- Last record of Celadon Archivist appears in the Tinctara Archives, shortly before its lower vaults sealed themselves with vines.

### 🔥 Vireya-Specific Events

- Collapse of the Crimson Court following the failed Ember Accord — a pact meant to bind flame to purpose, not passion.

- First sightings of the Crimson Echo, a spectral warrior stuck in a duel loop from the last battles of the Accord.

- Glasslash Serpent emerges after the betrayal of the Cinnabar Pact, during the Molten Shardfall.

- The Lava-Fused Behemoth awakens during the Deepflare Surge, destroying several Ember Shrines.

- Funeral Dancer is last seen during the Ash Gala, a ceremony that turned into massacre.

- Bannerbound Revenants begin appearing across highland warfields — remnants of soldiers whose banners were never burned.

---

### 🌀 Lingering Fractures (Global Phenomena)

- Hue Distortion Zones: Places where color behaves erratically — dangerous but filled with relics and lost lore.

- Memory Echoes grow more common, allowing attuned players to glimpse or interact with the world before the shatter.

- Unconfirmed rumors of a Tyrian resurgence — manipulators of all hues through twisted synthesis.

---


## 🌑 Current Era – The Dimming Cycle

> “You are born without color, and must earn your hue.”

The world is now color-fragmented, held together by:
- Huebound champions who tether themselves to relics and spirits.
- Memory Echoes hidden across the realms.
- Hue Archive Fragments containing ancient knowledge and lost choices.

<!--
The world lies shattered into Hue Realms, each dominated by its own chromatic law:
- 🌿 Huevale pulses with alchemical memory — vines dream in green.
- 🔥 Vireya burns with history and rage — every duel a page in ash.
- 🌊 Iriseld drowns in reflection and storm — memory drips like rain, and the sky forgets to fall.
- 🟪 Myrrala: dreams and identity layered over illusion.
- ☀️ Luxeran (soon): gold-lit mirage where joy is currency and prophecy lies.
- 🪨 Auralith (soon): necrotemples and rotting scrolls — memory etched in dust.
-->

Color cults, scavenger-warlocks, and Null-touched horrors roam unchecked.  
Some seek to revive the Prismara. Others wish to unmake color itself.

---

A colorless figure walks the cracks between Realms — the Prismwalker.  
They can wield any hue… but not without cost.

Some call them the Core’s heir.  
Others, the last mistake of a dying light.

The Prism is broken. The Core is gone.  
The world waits, fractured and humming.

---

The question remains:

> “Will you reforge the Prism? Or let color die screaming?”
<!--
The goal is whispered in every tongue: 
Reforge the Prism, or let the hues burn themselves out forever.
-->

---

<!--
## 📘 Emerging Threads (Foreshadowed in Lore)

The Dimming is accelerating — hues are beginning to fade unless tethered.

Nullborn activity is increasing — even in high skies and deep roots.

Hue Anomalies suggest something stirs beyond the current Orders — perhaps new colors, or colorless forms of will.

Whispers tell of a Seventh Hue, unbound by prism or order… one that sings between frequencies.
