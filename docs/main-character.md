## 🧬 Core Concept

> “Born without color. Bound to none. Shaped by every hue.”

The Prismwalker is a colorless vessel, awakened in the ruins of Nullshade. They are not entirely human, nor entirely divine — they are what remains of the Core’s final will. Their body is a canvas, absorbing pigment, personality, and memory from the world around them.

They are not remembered by the world… and don’t remember it either. Their existence is disruptive to the colored Realms, drawing awe, fear, or hostility.

## 🧑‍🎨 Visual Appearance

- Starts as gray-toned, semi-translucent — like living glass or ash  
- Gradually absorbs streaks of color based on chosen paths (arms, eyes, aura, scars shift with bound hues)  
- Customizable silhouette: humanoid but androgynous/neutral to reflect color-fluid identity  
- Prism shard embedded in their chest or spine — glows with hue(s) currently bound

## 🧭 Character Arc Themes

- **Identity through choice**: You don’t begin as anything — you become through action.
- **Balance vs. dominance**: Will you harmonize the hues or wield them to crush opposition?
- **Memory and myth**: The world forgot you… or never knew you. But the shards remember.

## 🧠 Personality System (Optional Gameplay Tie-In)

As you bind to hues, your dialogue and emotional tone shift subtly based on dominant colors:

| Bound Color | Affects Personality    | Example Shift                  |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Green       | Patient, curious       | Calm, nature-based metaphors   |
| Red         | Bold, reactive         | More direct, emotional choices |
| Blue        | Thoughtful, logical    | Strategic or aloof responses   |
| Purple      | Mysterious, empathetic | Dreamlike, poetic dialogue     |
| Yellow      | Charismatic, witty     | Humor, riddles, merchant-speak |
| Brown       | Grounded, grim         | Honest, fatalistic tones       |

You can roleplay with or against these — the game doesn’t lock you in, but the world may react based on your "color presence."

## ⚔️ Combat & Ability Style

### Core Ability – Huebinding

- Bind up to 3 hues at once. Swap in real-time or at shrines.
- **Passive:** Each color grants passive bonuses (regen, speed, resistance, etc.)
- **Active:** Access to 1 major ability per bound color  
  *(e.g., red = dash-strike, green = root trap, purple = clone illusion)*

### Ultimate – Prismatic Burst

Unlockable when all 6 hues are mastered — release all bound hues in a devastating mixed-color ability.  
**Visual:** Fractal burst of paint/light that reshapes the terrain.

## 🗣️ Dialogue/Choice System

Dialogue trees affected by:

- Color affinity  
- NPC’s region/hue alignment  
- Moral stance: Harmony / Control / Abandonment

You can either:

- Reunite the Orders through empathy and memory  
- Dominate the hues to rebuild the Core in your image  
- Reject color entirely and let Nullshade consume the world

## 🪞 Backstory (Intentionally Unclear)

You are either:

- The echo of the Core, forged by the Prism’s collapse  
- A forgotten child of the Prismara, locked away during the Color War  
- A weapon designed by the Tyrian Purge that never activated… until now

The truth may be chosen, uncovered, or never known.  
Each ending may confirm or reject different possibilities.
