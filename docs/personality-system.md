You might speak with both metaphor and conviction, or mask a threat in charm.

**Example: Blue + Red**  
> “This is a strategic burn. Fire is just another kind of math.”

**Example: Green + Purple**  
> “The roots remember, even when the leaves forget. Listen, and they’ll show you the dream.”

**NPC Dialogue Branches:**

> “You smell like tree bark and old songs (Green). I’ll trust you.”

**Factions may favor or fear you based on your dominant hue:**

- Blue-aligned character in a Red faction may be seen as a “calculating snake”  
- Yellow in a Brown zone may be seen as naive or a trickster

Final choices and ending tone shift subtly depending on your long-term hue alignment —  
affecting music, dialogue, and even animation tone.
