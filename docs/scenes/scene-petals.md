## 🎙️ Narration (Internal Monologue)
> “Ink fades. Roots do not.  
> If you write in leaflight, even forgetting can bloom.”

## NPC Encounter – Celadon Archivist

The archivist is gently humming, hands stained with rune-dust.  
She gestures to a cracked porcelain shard glowing faintly.  
> “You’re out of order. Good. The stories might behave for you.”

When shown the shard:  
> “This one’s humming your name… but it hasn’t been glazed yet.”

## Puzzle: Living Index

The player must search for three Verdant Bloomshards to reconstruct a “lost entry”:  
1. 🟩 Rootling Glossary (hidden inside a sprouting manuscript — use Vine Grasp to unwrap it)
2. 🟦 Aqueous Addendum (revealed by casting Mind Echo on a waterlogged scroll)
3. 🟩 Photosynthetic Appendix (found by realigning sunbeams through rotating vines above skylights)

### Puzzle Prompt:
> “Pages that grew — truths the ink never dared.”

Completing this forms a glowing green entry titled: 
**“The Grove That Read Itself.”**

---

## 👹 Ambush – Overgrown Index Beast

*As the shard is slotted into the central podium, vines twist violently and manifest a beast made of ink-soaked bark and papyrus — the Index Beast.*

### Attacks:
- Sap Spray, Binding Bookmark, Pollen Fog

### Weak to:
- Cobalt’s Static Dash (to clear fog and hit its inner script-core)

## 🧠 Memory Echo – Forgotten Reader

Victory causes the room to quiet. A spectral scholar appears, reading aloud an unfinished line:

> “We planted stories to remember the forest… 
> but they only remembered how we left.”

Unlocks: Hue Archive Entry: **“Of Moss and Memory: The Celadon Codex”**

---

## 🚪 Scene Exit – Spiral of Runes

A staircase of luminous vine-covered runes unfurls.

If the player carries the full Codex entry:  
> “May the page never close on you.”

If not:  
> “A leaf without ink is just silence waiting to forget.”
