🎮 Combat Trial – Ember Echo Duel

Once dialogue ends, the Duelist ignites.
A shadowy echo of yourself steps into the arena behind you.

Combat Mechanic: Ashbind Echo

Crimson reflection mimics your combat style but faster.

If you die, you leave a permanent scorchmark in the arena that appears in future visits.

🧠 Memory Echo (Arena Vision)

Upon victory or surrender, the Duelist drops a shard.
Using Earthen’s Memory Echo reveals:

> Amaranth and a younger Prismara fighting side by side.
“If we die here, let it mean something.”
She sets herself ablaze to protect him.



Unlocks: Hue Archive Entry: “The Ember Accord”
