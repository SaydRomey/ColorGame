NPC Encounter

A robed figure stands before a loom of soot-stained cloth.
She doesn’t look up. She doesn’t need to.

<div align="center">
  <img src="../assets/npcs/isabelline-widow.png" alt="Isabelline Widow" width="300">  
  </br><i>Isabelline Widow — Weaver of Warnings</i></br>
</div>Widow:

> “He lied with a smile. I still wear the dust.”
“The thread shivers. Someone nearby has blood on a borrowed name.”

🪨 [Earthen-Bound] “Let me see what the silence won’t tell.”

🟥 [Crimson-Bound] “What he bled for, I’ll finish.”

👹 Combat Encounter: Caput Marionette & Tapestry Watcher

A stone arm twitches inside a sarcophagus. Another falls silently from the ceiling...

  </br><i>Caput Marionette — animated by forgotten guilt<br>Tapestry Watcher — whispers decisions you didn’t make</i></br>
</div>Combat Cue:

Music slows. Dust rises unnaturally.
The Watcher speaks in lines you almost said.

Use Earthen’s Memory Echo to expose truth.

Violet’s Glamour Pulse reveals which is fake.

🧠 Memory Echo (Lore Reveal)

After combat, lighting the Bistre Lantern near a cracked mural shows:

> The Caput Mortuum Ascetic handing a phylactery to a dying Prismara mage.
“You’ll forget yourself to buy us time. That is the price of stalling death.”

🚪 Scene Exit: Coffin Gate

A sarcophagus ahead glows.
To exit, you must place one “true name” into the tomb — one that you’ve discovered or remembered.

If none entered:

> “Then the silence must choose one from you.”
