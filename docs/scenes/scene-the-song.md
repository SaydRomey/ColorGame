### [CAMERA]
Side-view with vertical traversal elements — branches and broken arches form layered platforms.  
A massive vine-wrapped harp rises in the background, broken strings reaching into the canopy.  

### [HUD]
- 🌿 Verdant Bound: Thorn Trail, Root Mend
- 🪨 Earthen Equipped: Decay Touch, Echo Weight
- 🟪 Violet (Optional): Dream-Warp

## 🎙️ Narration (Voice-over)
> “The trees remember the song.  
> But something in it soured… and now it chokes the grove.”

## NPC Encounter – Limerick Druid (Hidden)

*After solving a minor illusion-puzzle, the Limerick Druid emerges, 
playing a single haunting note on his oaken flute.*

### 🎭 Dialogue (in limerick):
> This grove once sang love to the sky,  
> But now it just whispers a lie.  
> If you hear the last tune,  
> Beware of the moon —  
> Its silence is sharper than cry.

He offers the player a task: 
repair the grove’s music by realigning three Harmonic Roots 
— each tuned to a color’s emotional resonance.

---

## 🎮 Puzzle Sequence – Harmonic Root Alignments

Three vine-covered instruments must be “played” via Color-Attuned Actions:
- 1. 🟩 Verdant: Use Thorn Trail to cut open a vine tangle and regrow a leafy lute.
- 2. 🪨 Earthen: Apply Echo Weight on a drumstone to harmonize its bass pulse.
- 3. 🟪 Violet (if available): Cast Dream-Warp to reassemble a spectral violin across dimensions.

### Puzzle Prompt:
> “Three played hearts. One broken note.”

When all are restored, the massive harp behind the grove begins to hum with soft harmonic light.

## 👹 Combat Interruption – Saproot Cultist (Echoform)

The Limerick Druid gasps and vanishes in smoke as a twisted echo of a Saproot Cultist bursts from the harp's shadow.

Their voice is layered, distorted like an overplayed tape.

Uses Verdant Corruption and Decay Snare to trap movement.


### Combat Cue:
Ambient music distorts as vines coil erratically.  
Use Thorn Trail defensively and Decay Touch to sever corrupted growths.

---

## 🧠 Memory Echo – Beneath the Roots

Defeating the Echoform triggers a memory buried in the harp’s base:

> A melody composed by the Malachite Oracle and a Prismara traveler… 
> before the Prism fractured.

The scene flashes briefly: 
a peaceful moment between two figures exchanging a glowing green note under moonlight.

Unlocks: **Hue Archive Entry: “The Lullaby of Tinctara”**

---

## 🚪 Scene Exit – Moss Gate

The harp parts its strings like curtains, 
revealing a narrow passage bound in flowering vines.

If the player has completed all color alignments:  
> “The song forgives. The grove listens once more.”

If not:  
> “Return when your heart remembers how to bloom.”
