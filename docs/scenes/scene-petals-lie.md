NPC Encounter

A pair of identical figures sway in a clearing — each beckoning you to follow a different path...

<div align="center">
  <img src="../assets/npcs/wisteria-enchantress-mirror.png" alt="Wisteria Enchantress (Mirrored)" width="300">  
  </br><i>Wisteria Enchantress – One speaks softly. The other blinks.</i></br>
</div>Enchantress A:

> “You already chose me, remember? Come — you’re safe here.”



Enchantress B:

> “That’s not me. She’s just your hope wearing my voice.”



Dialogue Options (Color-Gated):

🟪 [Violet-Bound] “I see both. But I trust neither. Let’s test the dream.”

🟨 [Aurelian-Bound] “Only the one who laughs without blinking is real.”

🟦 [Cobalt-Bound] “The mirror broke before you lied. That’s your tell.”

🎮 Puzzle Sequence – Veil Spiral Illusion Path

Both Enchantresses vanish.
The path ahead becomes layered in five mirrored spirals — only one is real.

Puzzle Mechanics:

Each platform flickers with a faint pulse tied to your equipped hue.

Use Illusion Clone to send a double ahead — if it vanishes, path is false.

Optional: Radiant Echo lights up the correct path momentarily.

👹 Ambush Encounter: Doppelshade & Razzflare Imps

After the second spiral, laughter echoes — the player’s reflection steps out...

  </br><i>Illusory ambush — your reflection lies louder than the tricksters</i></br>
</div>Combat Cue:

A mirror shatters mid-screen. The reflection attacks first.

Use Violet’s Glamour Pulse to reveal illusions.

Razzflare Imps disrupt UI and emit illusion flashes.

🧠 Memory Echo (Lore Vision)

At the spiral’s center, a glowing Heliotrope blooms beside a crystalized mask.
Touching it with Violet Bound active triggers a vision:

> Fandango Duelstar performing before a silent crowd of mirrors. One mirror weeps.
“Don’t applaud. Just remember me in color.”



Unlocks: Hue Archive Entry: “The Petaled Lie”


---

🚪 Scene Exit: Bloomfold Arch

An arch of living vines rearranges itself.
To pass, the player must recite their last three dialogue choices or allow the dream to do so “for them.”

If incorrect:

> “The dream bends around you. But it never forgets where you flinched.”
