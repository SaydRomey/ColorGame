## 🎙️ Narration (Internal Monologue / Voice‑over)
> “The desert breathes in heat, but sees in light.  
> Each step may crumble truth — or reveal it.”

---

## NPC Encounter
*A figure steps from the mirage, 
a luminous monk with lacquered staff and sun‑baked robes, 
the **Gamboge Monk** emerges.*

### Gamboge Monk:
> “A step in silence carries more weight than thunder.  
> Dare you walk between sun and shadow, Prismwalker?”

- 🟨 **[Aurelian‑Bound]**: “Light reveals wounds. Let me heal them.”

- 🟦 **[Cobalt‑Bound]**: “Echo your silence—teach me to listen.”

## 🎮 Environmental Puzzle (Color Mechanic)

The monk gestures to an open courtyard of broken sunstones and faded glyphs.

### Puzzle Prompt:
> “Speak the truth of the sun, earth, and shade.”

- 🟨 Use **Aurelian’s Radiant Flare** to ignite the sunstone wall (light).
- 🟩 Use **Verdant’s Saproot Shield** to grow vines over cracked tiles (growth).
- 🟦 Use **Cobalt’s Mind Echo** to restore the shattering sound‑glyph inscriptions (memory).

When all three break, a golden mirage blooms, 
revealing a hidden passage descending into the sands.

## 👹 Ambush Encounter: Sand‑Blight Scorpions
*Emerging from beneath the sun-warmed dunes, three sleek, 
glassy‑armored [Sand‑Blight Scorpions]() burst forth, claws raised.*

### Combat Cue:
Music shifts to a rhythmic drumbeat 
as the heat intensifies—mirages flicker, and UI edges shimmer in wavering light.
- Use **Cobalt’s Stormglass Barrier** to reflect their reflective carapaces.
- Use **Verdant’s Vine Grasp** to entangle their legs in oasis vines.
- Optional: Use **Aurelian’s Lightform Cloak** to blind them mid‑burst.

## 🧠 Memory Echo (Lore Discovery)

After defeating them, the player descends into the orchard’s sunken crypt.  
An Aurelian relic, the **Aureolin Quill**, glimmers faintly among scattered hymn scrolls.

Activating it triggers a vision:  
> *A priestess inscribes vows under the full desert sun…*  
> “The light will judge us equal.”  
> The quill glows, and the vision flickers as it fades.

Unlocks: **Hue Archive Entry “Oath of the Sun‑Born”**

## 🚪 Scene Exit: Mirrored Oasis Gate

A glowing glyph-dome appears—a circular gate of sand and light.  
Opens only when the player channel at least two completed glyph fountains 
and has passed the reflection puzzle.

If not (dialogue hint):
> *“Your light flickers. The sun demands more than warmth… it demands clarity.”*
