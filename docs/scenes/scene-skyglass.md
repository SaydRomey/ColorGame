NPC Encounter

On a high-floating shard of blueglass, a figure dances slowly in the wind — weightless, drifting in midair...

  </br><i>Cerulean Skydancer – Spirit of the Storm Hymn</i></br>

🎮 Traversal Puzzle – Wind Memory Trial

The Skydancer twirls into the storm, vanishing.
Glass pillars begin to shift in rhythm to unseen song patterns.

Puzzle Mechanics:

Jump only when notes from windchimes match the background pulse.

Wrong steps rewind your movement three platforms back.

Correct use of Static Dash allows skipping certain gaps.

👹 Midair Encounter: Skycall Wraiths

As the puzzle nears completion, spectral wraiths rise on wind trails...

  </br><i>Skycall Wraiths — screamers that cancel gliding</i></br>
</div>Combat Cue:

Wind distorts; clouds darken. One wraith begins to sing — distorting gravity.

Use Cobalt’s Mind Echo to create a sonic pulse.

Optional: Trigger Verdant’s Skygrowth Seed to anchor glass vines as cover.

🧠 Memory Echo (Lore Vision)

At the final spire’s peak, a glass orb waits. Touching it with Cobalt Bound active reveals:

> The Zaffre Glasswright, crying silently as she seals a memory inside a vial.
“Let him forget me. If it will let him live.”



Unlocks: Hue Archive Entry: “The Storm and the Shard”

🚪 Scene Exit: Singing Gate

A floating harp-shaped arch activates only when the player glides through it in rhythm with the windsong.

If timing is off:

> “The sky remembers grace. Try again — but lighter.”
