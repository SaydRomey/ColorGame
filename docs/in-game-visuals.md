## 🌈 Options for Visualizing Bound Hues (In-Game Sprite)

### 🔹 1. Subtle Color Veins / Fractures

Faint glowing cracks or veins appear on their skin, arms, or neck.  
Each hue has its own zone:

| Hue  | Visual Zone              |
|------|--------------------------|
| Green | Vines along limbs       |
| Red   | Pulsing near the heart  |
| Blue  | Around temples and fingers |

If three hues are bound, they can “mix” toward the chest/core.

---

### 🔹 2. Prism Core Glow

- The crystal shard in their chest glows with the hue(s) currently equipped.
- For multiple hues:
  - Slow, shifting gradient pulse
  - Split prism shards orbiting/floating

---

### 🔹 3. Aura or Edge Lighting

Thin outline glow or shimmering particles surrounding them:

| Hue Count | Effect                                      |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Single    | Halo or shimmer                             |
| Two       | Split left/right or flickering back and forth |
| Three     | Rotating prismatic halo (faint to avoid visual clutter) |

---

### 🔹 4. Color Trails While Moving

Movement leaves a ghost trail in the active hue(s):

| Hue    | Trail Effect            |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Purple | Dreamy sparkles         |
| Red    | Embers                  |
| Yellow | Flickers like sunlight  |

---

### 🔹 5. Clothing Tint Adaptation

- Parts of the cloak adapt:
  - Edges
  - Inner lining
  - Runic symbols
- These shift to match active hues.
- Cloak remains mostly gray or desaturated to contrast the added hues.

---

## 🌀 Suggestion for HUD/Gameplay Tie-In

- Show bound colors as **gems or icons orbiting the core shard** in the UI.
- On interaction or attack, the **active hue pulses subtly on the sprite**  
  (e.g., arm glows red briefly when attacking with a red-bound skill).
