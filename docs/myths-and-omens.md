# Myths and Omens

## 📖 The Myth of the Prismwalker

> "When the Prism fell, the world splintered. When the last hue fades, one without color shall rise."

Long ago, before the Prism shattered, the seers of the Violet Order told of a being born in shadow but touched by every hue. Neither of one realm nor one soul, this wanderer — the Prismwalker — would arrive when the world could no longer bear its own brilliance.

**The myth claims:**

- The Prismwalker has no fixed color — their soul is clear, absorbing the essence of others.
- They walk among factions unseen or misunderstood, never fully accepted, yet strangely familiar.
- In one hand, they carry a shard of the original Prism — faintly glowing, always cold.
- Some say they were born from the Core’s last scream; others say they are the final hue, waiting to be named.

Depending on who you ask, the Prismwalker is:
- A savior who will reunite the colors into harmony, or...
- A catalyst who will decide which color remains, and let all others die.

These can be scattered throughout the **Nullshade zone**:  
- **Crystal Monoliths** show fragmented quotations of the Prismara.  
- **Floating shards** echo whispers when passed.  
- **Broken architecture** carries etched lines of regret or cryptic warnings.  
- **Voidlings**, if they communicate at all, do so in fractured syllables or thoughts like cracked mirrors.

> “To fracture the Prism is to unravel time.”  
> “The Core did not fall. It was fled from.”

**Echoes of the Prismara (fading fragments):**  
> “Balance isn’t stillness — it’s motion in agreement.”  
> “We sang in hues, and it was enough. Until we envied the chorus.”

**Final Warnings (approaching the Core):**

**Voidling Murmurs (subtle ambient whispers):**

> *"You brought color. We bring rest."*  

#### 🪨 Glyph Fragments (Environmental Puzzle Text)
Carved into floating shards, stone ruins, or prism-locked gates.  
These can hint at past sins, metaphysics, or unlock mechanics:

1. "Six stand. One breaks. None remain whole."
2. "The mirror sees only the first lie."
3. "Hue is hunger made beautiful."
4. "Echo what you are not, and the gate will fade."
5. "A colorless path must be taken by halves."
6. "Where time forgets to move, step backward into now."
7. "We built a prism to house the truth. It burned."
8. "The seventh hue never had a name."

(These may be used as activation phrases, clues to perspective puzzles, or translated via an artifact.)

#### 🧩 Nullshade Puzzle Riddles
Used on sealed doors, prism relics, or forgotten altars, often requiring perspective changes, color negation, or rotating shards.

1. “I am seen by none but all reflect me. What am I?”
   → **Answer:** *The Void*

2. “Split me and I multiply. Bind me and I vanish. I color your world, but have none. What am I?”
   → **Answer:** *Light*

3. “I follow each color but belong to none. I am the space between choices. Who am I?”
   → **Answer:** *The Prismwalker*

4. “Born from the bloom, bled into war. I held the sum, and now I am sore. What was I?”
   → **Answer:** *The Prismatic Core*

5. “I speak in silence, echo the dead, walk without shadow, and name what you fled.”
   → **Answer:** *Memory*

Optional Mechanic: Wrong answers cause the **shard gates** to shimmer and fracture the UI subtly, or freeze time for a moment.
