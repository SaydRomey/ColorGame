## 📖 The Myth of the Prismwalker

> "When the Prism fell, the world splintered. When the last hue fades, one without color shall rise."

Long ago, before the Prism shattered, the seers of the Violet Order told of a being born in shadow but touched by every hue. Neither of one realm nor one soul, this wanderer — the Prismwalker — would arrive when the world could no longer bear its own brilliance.

**The myth claims:**

- The Prismwalker has no fixed color — their soul is clear, absorbing the essence of others.
- They walk among factions unseen or misunderstood, never fully accepted, yet strangely familiar.
- In one hand, they carry a shard of the original Prism — faintly glowing, always cold.
- Some say they were born from the Core’s last scream; others say they are the final hue, waiting to be named.

Depending on who you ask, the Prismwalker is:
- A savior who will reunite the colors into harmony, or...
- A catalyst who will decide which color remains, and let all others die.
