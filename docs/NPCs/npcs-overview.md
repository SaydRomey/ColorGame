#### 🌿 **Limerick Druid – Dialogue in Limericks**

**Upon First Meeting:**
> In the glen where the foxes all play,\
> I wandered and rhymed through the day.\
> If you follow the tune,\
> Don’t look at the moon —\
> It’s watching and wanders away.

**Offering Advice:**
> When vines block your path, don’t be mad —\
> They’re grumpy, not wicked or bad.\
> Just whisper a song,\
> Not too short or too long,\
> And they'll move — if they’re feeling unclad.

**On the Nature of Illusions:**
> An echo can dance like a deer,\
> And giggle a foot from your ear.\
> If the trees start to hum,\
> You should probably run —\
> Or you’ll marry a mushroom, I fear.

**When Using His Flute:**
> A note from this flute in my hand,\
> Can summon a trickster or band.\
> One puff and they leap,\
> Out of root, bark, or deep —\
> Though they rarely obey what I planned.

**If the Player Asks About the Prismwalker:**
> You’re colorless now — quite a feat!\
> A vessel both blank and complete.\
> Will you bloom or decay?\
> Well, either way…\
> The moss at your feet thinks you’re neat.

**On the Forest Responding to Magic:**
> The forest remembers each tread,\
> And whispers your dreams when you’ve fled.\
> But step with intent,\
> And you may just prevent\
> What the vines had been planning instead.
