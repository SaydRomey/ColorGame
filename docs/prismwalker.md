## 🩻 Phase: Nullshade Origin / Unbound State

### Visual:

- Cloaked in muted, tattered fabric that blends with the background — they’re forgotten, unseen.

- No facial features — evokes the idea of a being without identity or memory.

- Body is smooth, ashen stone or living clay, not yet cracked by color or story.

- The **prism shard** is the only source of color — a dim glint of **blue and pink hues**, implying first contact with emotion (blue = thought, pink = early empathy or mystery).

---

### 🌌 In-Game Implications:

- **Gameplay Start:** This could be the tutorial phase before Huebinding unlocks. The Prismwalker hasn’t bound any colors yet — they are truly “born without color.”

- **Dialogue Tone:** Almost silent or minimal. NPCs may be afraid, dismissive, or curious — unsure what this figure is.

- **Abilities:** Only base movement or passive aura effects (e.g., calming fear in creatures, slipping past guards unnoticed).

- **Music/Atmosphere:** Quiet, reverberant, with distant crystalline tones — as if the world itself is remembering them faintly.

## ✨ PRISMWALKER PROGRESSION — Becoming the Huebound

### 🧱 1. Nullborn Form (What You Shared)

- Hooded, featureless.

- Prism shard barely glowing — a dim, fractured blue/pink core.

- No distinct emotion or expression.

- Movement: slow, deliberate, almost like waking from stone.

---

### 🌿 2. First Huebound

> A choice is made — not with words, but with will.

- First bound color (e.g., Green):

	- Vines, iridescent patterns or moss begin to thread subtly from the shard down one arm.

	- Prismwalker gains faint irises. They look at the world, not through it.

	- Cloak becomes slightly more tattered, as if shedding the "nullskin."

	- Passive aura effect (e.g., calming wildlife or hearing roots speak).

---

### 🔥 3. Dual-Hued / Conflict Form

- Binding a second color (e.g., Red) introduces asymmetry:

	- One arm flickers with flame veins, the other hums with green life.

	- Facial expression now visible — torn between rage and stillness.

	- The shard pulses faster, like a second heartbeat.

- Cloak flares at the edges, lifted by unseen wind or emotion.

### 🌀 4. Trichromatic Balance (3 Colors Bound)

- Colors harmonize or clash visibly depending on your choices.

- You now emit a soft aura — visible in low light as a shimmer across surfaces.

- Parts of the body are now translucent or refracting light like a prism surface.

- The Prism shard sings when certain terrain or beings are near.

---

### 🌈 5. Master of Hues / Post-Prismatic

> You are no longer just a vessel. You are a lens.

- Six hues swirl in complex patterns across your body.

- The cloak is gone — replaced by a flowing mantle of living color.

- Terrain bends subtly in your presence — not in fear, but in reverence or resistance.

- Your silhouette pulses with a slow radiance — not constant, but reactive to thought/emotion.

- Eyes now show complex color wheels instead of pupils.
