> "You’ll know them by their chants — not spoken, but hissed between clenched teeth. And by the way they bleed fire, not red."



> "One ignites to strike. Two ignite to sanctify. A dozen? That’s a sermon, and you'd best run before they sing it."

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Searblood Cultist

Type:	Human (Mutated Zealot) / Ritual Flamebearer
Threat Level:	⚠️ Medium–High – Volatile, suicidal casters
First Emerged:	After the Cindersplit Mass Rites, Year of Ash 12


Description:

Searblood Cultists are flamebound zealots who bleed pyre-oil and chant to forgotten ember gods. Their bodies are branded with sigils, their veins simmering with volatile sacrament. In combat, they set themselves alight to hurl flamebursts or charge blindly into melee — dying in glorious combustion.

Hue Interaction:

Their Crimson hue grows unstable over time, erupting if not vented.

Can be briefly pacified with Crimson Weaver’s thread (if equipped), binding their rage into harmless movement.

Resist all Verdant and Earthen control; their faith consumes roots and stone alike.


Behavior:

Always aggressive, aggro range increases when other cultists are nearby.

Cast self-immolation buffs that increase damage but rapidly drain health.

On death, explode in a radius of scorched faithfire — lingering hazard zone.


Known Weaknesses:

Flame aura can be quenched by Cobalt-based mist or drowning effects.

Vulnerable during chant animations — interruptible with sound or silence-based attacks.

If separated from their shrine banners, they lose coordination and become unstable.


Notes:

Some claim the cultists’ final screams aren’t pain but rapture — their deaths a chosen release. Others insist they’re not cultists at all, just puppets burned hollow by something deeper in the stone. Either way, step lightly. Faith burns hotter than lava.
