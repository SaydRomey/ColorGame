🌑 Null-Root – The Core That Failed to Bloom

<div align="center">
  <h3>Null-Root</h3>
  <i>The Core tried to grow again. It failed beautifully.</i><br>
  <img src="../../assets/monsters/null-root.png" alt="Null-Root" width="300"><br>
  <i>"Even the void dreamed of life. That’s where the rot began."</i><br><br>
</div>Coiled like a vine from the core of nothing, the Null-Root is not plant, not beast, not crystal — but the suggestion of all three. It stirs beneath the broken geometry of Nullshade, its tendrils seeking light that no longer exists.

> "It germinated in absence — from a sliver of the Prism that refused to fade."



> "A tendril of hunger disguised as growth. Roots made of void-veins. A longing to begin again, in a world that no longer remembers how."



> "But growth without hue is not rebirth. It is corruption wearing hope."



> "To kill the Null-Root, you must offer what it seeks — a future it cannot digest."

Bestiary Entry

Name: Null-Root
Type: Voidspawn / False Flora
Threat Level: ⚠️⚠️ High (Environmental Threat)
First Emerged: Near the shattering of the Core Wound


---

Description:

A twisted, obsidian-like vine-creature. Its body pulses with multicolored crystal veins — a mockery of hue-life. It lashes out unpredictably from terrain, wrapping geometry into weapons. Unlike other entities, it doesn't see the Prismwalker — it feels them.


---

Hue Interaction:

Drawn to equipped Hue shards — becomes violent the more hues are active.

Grows passive if player unequips all hue-bound gear or uses “Voidstep” relic.



---

Behavior:

Burrows and strikes from any prism-corrupted terrain nearby.

Drags chunks of floating geometry into battle — hurling or using them as shields.

If ignored, will reshape the battlefield itself, corrupting puzzle zones and shrines.



---

Known Weaknesses:

Cannot be killed directly — must let it strike a Prismwalker shard to trigger decay bloom.

Once it latches to a hue-infused item, it begins dissolving — that item is sacrificed.

Exposed to the “Caput Mortuum Phylactery,” it becomes inert for one cycle.



---

Notes:

Emits a low, heartbeat-like thrum when nearby.

> [!WARNING]  ??  

Some echoes report a brief visual of the Prismwalker being “buried in roots” after defeating it — a non-lethal memory echo tied to its origin.
