🗿 The Bound – Witnesses of Stillness

</div>Lifelike stone figures scattered across Nullshade. Some kneel. Some reach. Some accuse — but none speak aloud.

Most are inert until a player acts violently nearby or attempts to flee too quickly.

When awakened, they move with slow, unnerving grace — as if remembering how to move. Their strikes are delayed but catastrophic.

Lore Entry

<details><summary>See The Bound Lore Entry</summary>Lore Entry: Fragment from “Etchings of the Silent Monolith” – recovered on a cracked memory shard in Prism Wound

> "We called them guardians, once. Remnants of the Prismara who refused hue. But I think now... they were simply those who saw too much."



> "You can hear them when you're not looking — feel your memories tighten in your chest like a thread pulling taut. They don't scream. They remember for you."



> "One bowed as I passed. The other raised a hand. Neither moved again. That night I dreamed of a battlefield I had never seen. I woke with my hands bruised — fingers curled like stone."



> "If silence had a form, it would kneel beside them."



— Archivist Reiss, “Final Echoes of the Core”

Bestiary Entry

Name: The Bound
Type: Dormant Sentinels / Memory Constructs
Threat Level: ⚠️ High (Only when triggered — reactive danger)
First Emerged: Post-Prism Collapse, Nullshade Core Rebound

Description:

The Bound are humanoid statues scattered throughout Nullshade. Each one is frozen in mid-movement — reaching, kneeling, shielding, or still. While most remain inert, some will stir if the player performs specific actions: attacking nearby, casting strong hue spells, or attempting to flee from memory puzzles.

When awakened, The Bound do not chase — they anticipate. Their movement is slow, deliberate, and seemingly tied to the player’s rhythm or pause. They retaliate with delayed but devastating strikes that cannot be dodged traditionally — only predicted through silence and stillness.


---

Hue Interaction:

Immune to all hue-based attacks.

Can be weakened by memory-based artifacts like the Bistre Lantern or the Isabelline Tapestry.

Calmed or bypassed by engaging with memory puzzles or reciting known truths.



---

Behavior:

Linger motionless in groups — creating tense, uncanny spaces.

Only one in a group typically animates at a time.

May mimic player movement seconds after it occurs — mimicking decision-making rather than motion.



---

Known Weaknesses:

Temporarily deactivated through full dialogue confession (truth mechanics).

Only vulnerable while reciting remembered dialogue options — during these moments, a shimmer reveals a hollow core.

Avoids areas where the player carries false names or unclaimed memories.



---

Notes:

In proximity to The Bound, audio muffles and time subtly distorts — causing a surreal pause effect.

When defeated, The Bound collapse into dust, leaving behind one whisper:

> “You remembered too loudly.”
