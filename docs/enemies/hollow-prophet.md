Lore Entry: Scorched prayer-scroll from the Aureolin Temple Ruins> "They say the Hollow Prophets were once true seers — priests who stared too long at the midday sun and saw only truth afterward."



> "Their sermons come in pulses. You don't hear them — you feel them. They light up every fear you've hidden in shadow and then ask: 'What will you burn to make it pure?'"



> "One knelt by the Eburnean Gate for days, unmoving, its voice cracking through heatwaves. I offered coin. It offered blindness."



> "There’s no god left in them — only clarity too sharp to carry."

Bestiary Entry

Name: Hollow Prophet
Type: Radiant Undead / Blinding Oracle
Threat Level: ⚠️ High – Mental disorientation, forced silence
First Emerged: Mid-Color War, during the Siege of Eburnea


---

Description:
Tall skeletal figures robed in faded ivory, faces veiled in cracked gold masks. They bear sunstaffs crowned with burning lenses. Each step leaves a branded rune in the sand. Their voice doesn’t echo — it scorches.


---

Hue Interaction:

Aurelian spells fuel their flash-rune intensity unless mirrored or redirected

Vulnerable to Cobalt silence spells and emotional resonance interference

Verdant abilities can root them briefly by overloading sensory bloom



---

Behavior:

Patrols ancient ruins and former shrines

Initiates combat with a “Sermon Pulse” — a flash-rune that inverts movement controls and destabilizes the HUD

Casts “Truthbrands” — radiant glyphs that bind targets who have lied in previous dialogue paths

Immune to most light-based attacks; feeds on them to cast stronger judgment spells



---

Known Weaknesses:

The Eburnean Dice can gamble a memory against their power, weakening them briefly

Illusion magic scrambles their sermon logic

Will not attack characters who carry unbroken vows or truth-touched relics



---

Notes:
Some believe Hollow Prophets cannot lie. Others think they burned their own lies away — and now hunt yours.

> “They do not seek followers. Only confessions.”
