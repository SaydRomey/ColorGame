Flickers like candlelight — always mid-performance.

Her every move is rhythmic, deadly, and beautiful.

> “When the crowd stopped clapping, she danced louder.”



> The Passion Stage once crowned duelists who fought with flair, each move a flourish, each wound a signature.
Fandango Duelstar was its final champion — a blur of glitter and blood, adored and feared. But when silence fell upon the Stage, she refused to stop.



> Now, only her shadow remains: the Fandancer Fragment. A looped echo of her last encore.
She duels no one. She performs to no crowd. Her blade still sings, but the music is memory.



> Step into her rhythm, and she welcomes you like a partner.
Mismatch her tempo, and you die offbeat.



> — Maskkeeper of the Liseran Shrine

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Fandancer Fragment

Type:	Illusion / Combat Echo
Threat Level:	⚠️ High – Pattern-locked Duelist Trap
First Emerged:	The ruins of the Passion Stage, Myrrala


Description:

A radiant illusion left behind by the last great duel of the Passion Stage. The Fandancer Fragment attacks in choreographed sequences, moving across tiles in precise, looped footwork.

She cannot be reasoned with — her battle is performance. Each step, spin, and lunge is tied to her final act.

Hue Interaction:

Neutral to most damage unless the player matches or disrupts her rhythm.

Cobalt’s Mind Echo can copy her next move for perfect parry timing.

Violet’s Illusion Clone lets the player “dance with her” safely from a distance.


Behavior:

Leaves glowing footstep markers that emit afterimages if followed in rhythm.

Can lock the player in a duet, forcing movement input to match her tempo or suffer damage.

Mid-fight, she may “bow” and reset her combo — this is your chance to break her rhythm with a disruptive hue.


Known Weaknesses:

Her illusion falters if the Rhythm Loop is broken (step out of her range mid-pattern).

Vulnerable to sudden tempo shifts — Aurelian Radiant Echo or Mauveine Flask can destabilize her choreography.

Mask shatters briefly when hit during her “bow” animation — that’s her true face.


Notes:

Defeating her grants a Spectral Footwork Fragment, which lets the player mimic stylish attacks during future duels.
Some players report hearing faint applause when they strike her final blow.
