> "When words fail, the forest builds its silence. And silence, once shaped, stands eternal."



> "The Grovebound Sentinels were not made—they were grown. Not by hands, but by decree. Root, stone, and memory braided into form by the elders of Huevale to guard what should never be touched, and to remember what must never be spoken."



> "They do not breathe. They do not speak. Yet they listen, eternally attuned to vibrations of trespass and desecration. Their vines reach deeper than the ruins they protect, and they rise not with anger, but purpose."



> "One does not slay a Sentinel. One reasons with it—not through words, but by proving worth. Solve the forest’s puzzle, and the Sentinel sleeps once more. Fail… and the forest will erase the mistake with quiet precision."

</details>Bestiary Entry

Name:	Grovebound Sentinel

Type:	Living Construct / Ruin Guardian
Threat Level:	⚠️ Variable – Immobile unless provoked
First Emerged:	Pre-Shattering Design, Active in Post-Shattering Era


Description:

Colossal guardians entwined with the roots of Huevale’s sacred ruins, Grovebound Sentinels are carved from ancient hardwood and infused with slow, steady thought. They remain still for centuries, indistinguishable from surrounding trees—until something violates the sanctity of what they were made to protect.

Hue Interaction:

Immune to all elemental damage and direct hue-based attacks.

Activation linked to environmental triggers—tampering with relics, puzzles, or shrines.

Can only be pacified through puzzle-solving, sequence restoration, or color alignment.


Behavior:

Awakens only when relics or environmental puzzles are mishandled or bypassed.

Responds with deliberate, devastating strikes and area-denial vine attacks.

Returns to dormancy once nearby puzzle or shrine is restored or respectfully disengaged.


Known Weaknesses:

Cannot be defeated by force—must be disabled through environmental resolution.

Weak points (glowing knot cores) become exposed only when incorrect color combinations are attempted nearby.

Vulnerable to Memory Echoes that resonate with its original oath or bonded spirit.


Notes:

Many explorers mistake them for harmless statues until it is too late. Some forest guides swear that Sentinels occasionally move imperceptibly when no one watches—adjusting position as if listening for the next trespass. Their silence carries a weight not of menace, but judgment.
