> I painted it once — or tried to.
Every stroke vanished. Not faded. Not erased. Just... unremembered.



> The Wyrm wasn’t hostile. Not at first. It followed my reflection for hours. I thought it was curious.



> But then my brush hand forgot what it held. My name smeared across the canvas.



> It didn’t eat thoughts. It ate the part of me that thought I had them.



> If you're reading this, don’t look in mirrored cliffs.
Don’t listen too hard when the breeze starts whispering.



> And if you feel a shiver in your spine — it’s already coiled around it.



> – Signed only: “P.”

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Whisperglass Wyrm

Type:	Illusion Serpent / Burrowing Mirage
Threat Level:	⚠️ Moderate – Spatial and Sensory Disruptor
First Emerged:	Post-Dissonance Storm Cycle


Description:

The Whisperglass Wyrm is an aerial burrower formed from skyfract glass and dream-echo. It shifts through the floating cliffs as if they were mist, rarely seen until it’s already inside your perception.

It doesn’t bite. It convinces you it already did — and that you bled.

Hue Interaction:

Refracts Hue-based attacks unless revealed.

Temporarily visible under Cobalt’s Mind Echo when used near reflective terrain.

Immobilized briefly by Verdant’s Skygrowth Seed cast on fractured skyglass veins.


Behavior:

Remains dormant beneath floating landmasses until a player lingers too long near mirrored surfaces.

Behavior cycle:

Prey Reflection: mimics distant silhouettes of the player to bait movement.

Mirror Dive: disappears into nearby glass, re-emerging unpredictably.

Fracture Howl: emits a static-chime sound that scrambles traversal inputs unless countered.



Known Weaknesses:

Exposed by Payne’s Brush illusion-reveal strokes.

Loses invisibility if caught in stormlight flashes or lightning surges.

Vulnerable when attempting to “sync” with the player’s reflection — brief window for high-damage strikes.


Notes:

Whisperglass Wyrms are believed to be remnants of sky-serpents that were reflected into extinction.

What you see is never just where it is — only where it thinks you’ll look.
