Bestiary Entry

Name:	Bloodroot Effigy

Type:	Ritual Golem / Floral Martyr Construct
Threat Level:	⚠️ Very High – Reflective Damage & Environmental Risk
First Emerged:	Ember Shrines, shortly after Verdant Suppression War


Description:

The Bloodroot Effigy is a grotesque sacred construct — a hybrid of bone, bloom, and flame. Originally created as a shrine to fallen warriors, it grew restless under constant veneration. Now it walks, its joints creaking with hymns and its veins coursing with sacrificial heat. Any who strike it are struck in return — unless their cause aligns with the green.

Hue Interaction:

Reflects all direct Crimson or Earthen damage back at the attacker.

Only Verdant-bound players can bypass the pain mirror — the roots recognize kin.

Can be pacified with Cobalt Mind Echo, revealing fragments of the memories it contains.


Behavior:

Moves slowly until attacked — then enters a rage phase, swinging with vine-wrapped fists.

Emits a damage-sharing aura — all within it are harmed when it takes damage.

Occasionally drops to its knees and prays — healing over time unless interrupted.


Known Weaknesses:

Vulnerable to stealth-based attacks or environmental triggers (falling pillars, acid blooms).

Weakens when exposed to pure light or mirrored flame (used in certain shrine puzzles).

During prayer stance, can be calmed permanently by using Verdant Lullaby relic.


Notes:

The bloodroot vines inside it are still alive. If you cut it down gently, it weeps — and sometimes, just sometimes, leaves behind a relic carved with a name that isn’t yours… but feels like it could’ve been.
