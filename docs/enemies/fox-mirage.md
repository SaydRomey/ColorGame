Appears as multiple foxlike shapes darting across terrain.

Leaves afterimages that cause AI misdirection and player targeting confusion.

Lore Entry

<details><summary>See Fox Mirage Lore Entry</summary>Lore Entry: Spoken by Nacarat the Laughing Blade, overheard near Emberlight Cliffs

> “Oh, that one? The Fox Mirage? She's a clever ghost, or maybe just a lie wrapped in fur.”



> “She’s not real — not the way we are. She’s an ember thought that got too smug. You see her in the corner of your eye, or in the shimmer on a blade, or laughing just before the strike lands. She’s the memory of being hunted, kept warm too long in the coals.”



> “They say she was once a trickster in life — Nacarat’s sister, some claim — weaving illusions into flame. When she died, the desert didn’t let her go. It just learned her trick.”



> “If you want to fight her, don’t. Fight what she makes you think she is. That’s where she hides — behind your own mistake.”



> — Whispered with a grin by a campfire, then the wind carried the grin away.

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Fox Mirage

Type:	Illusory Predator / Ember Trickster
Threat Level:	⚠️ Medium – Disorienting, fast, rarely lethal alone
First Emerged:	Post-Prism Flicker Era, near Cinnabar Spires


Description:

The Fox Mirage is not a creature in the strictest sense — it is a living hallucination woven from heat shimmer and ember-magic. Shaped like a swift vulpine form with glowing red sigils and a laughter-like yip, it appears in multiples and vanishes in flames. No two encounters with it are the same.

Hue Interaction:

Reacts violently to truth-based magic (e.g. Violet clarity spells or mirrored terrain).

Can only be struck while passing through reflection zones or during a failed clone transition.

Immune to direct tracking, weak against area-of-effect detection spells (like Prism Pulse).


Behavior:

Appears in triads — one real, two fakes.

Frequently retreats after ambushes, reappearing unexpectedly at player flanks.

Leaves behind heat mirage traps that burn slow and confuse targeting systems.


Known Weaknesses:

Temporarily revealed by Cinnabar Seal, a relic that forces illusions to resolve.

If mirrored against reflective surfaces (e.g., lava glass or still obsidian pools), its real form can be distinguished.

Does not cross echo-silence zones (where illusions lose coherence).


Notes:

Wandering bards claim that if you defeat the Fox Mirage without breaking a sweat, she visits you in dreams — not in anger, but curiosity. She wants to see how your story ends. Or maybe she wants to rewrite it.
