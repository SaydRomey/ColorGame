Lore Entry: Fragmented field report from the Bistre Archivist, sealed in ash> “At first, I thought them ash-fleas. Harmless, if persistent. But the swarm began to sing — in names. Names I had forgotten.”



> “They circle. They whisper. And if one touches skin, a piece of memory loosens.”



> “Caput Mortuum warned us: failed phylacteries don’t just break — they scatter. A name is a soul’s handle. These insects collect… and misuse.”



> “I burned the scrolls. I prayed over the ink. Still, they murmured the names I never told anyone.”



> “If you’ve forgotten your own voice, they’ll help. But it will cost you.”

Bestiary Entry

Name: Phylactery Swarm
Type: Soul-Fragmented Parasites
Threat Level: ⚠️ Moderate-to-Severe – Memory Drain
First Emerged: Post-Shattering, shortly after the collapse of the Phylactery Vault

Description:
A drifting swarm of glimmering, fly-like constructs with miniature glyphs engraved on their chitin. Each holds a fragment of a soul — stolen, gifted, or long abandoned. They buzz softly, repeating half-spoken names and severed dreams.

Hue Interaction:

Brown-bound memory spells repel or redirect their feeding pattern.

Violet illusions confuse their targeting (they can’t find the “real” name).

Blue mind-based defenses lock out name resonance, reducing damage over time.


Behavior:

Aggressive in clusters; each hit reduces XP, disrupts equipped memory-bound relics, or causes temporary skill fog.

They prioritize targets with the most stored names, such as players with saved dialogue trees, memory fragments, or death-echoes.

If fed a “forgotten name” (e.g. an unused True Name), the swarm dissipates peacefully.


Known Weaknesses:

Fire magic burns them outright — especially from purified sources.

Sonic pulses from Violet-aligned instruments cause disarray in their flight pattern.

Bistre Lantern stuns them in shadow if activated in silence.


Notes:
Destroying a swarm sometimes releases “Whispers in Dust,” a rare crafting essence used for soul-bound relic upgrades. But if you kill them while carrying a forgotten name, your own may become unstable in the Codex.
