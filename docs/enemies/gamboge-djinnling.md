Lore Entry: Fragment from "Desert Pacts and Ash-Laced Jars" by Relic-Seer Yawen the Uncorked> "You don't summon a Gamboge Djinnling. You entertain one. And if it likes your song, your scent, or your story — it offers a deal. Usually bad."



> "One drifted near my caravan during the brass eclipse. My horse learned to speak three tongues. My guide forgot how to walk forward."



> "Never thank it. Never bargain without irony. And never uncork anything that still feels warm."



> "They're children of the smoke left behind when gods abandon their lamps."

Bestiary Entry

Name: Gamboge Djinnling
Type: Elemental Trickster / Smoke Spirit
Threat Level: ⚠️ Variable – Harmless or catastrophic
First Emerged: During the Sun-Flecked Famine, post-Shattering


---

Description:
Gamboge Djinnlings are child-sized spirits formed from residual incense and holy lacquer. They shimmer like sunlight through amber resin and float unpredictably, giggling in short bursts. Upon contact, they inflict randomized magical effects — buffs, debuffs, or surreal transformations.


---

Hue Interaction:

Drawn to Aurelian-bound players; reacts to radiant spells with playful mimicry

Temporarily soothed by Orange Peel Charms or trickster-aligned dialogue

Disrupted by silence, darkness, or logical riddles



---

Behavior:

May offer players “bargains” — usually with ironic outcomes

Cast chaotic aura bursts at short range, altering spell loadouts or HP temporarily

May aid players in combat if amused or impressed

Flee when too predictable — thrives on spontaneity



---

Known Weaknesses:

Vulnerable to emotional clarity (truth-bound spells, honesty artifacts)

Cannot pass through pure darkness or geometric constraint sigils

Temporarily dissipated by citrus oils or harmonized chants



---

Notes:
Some scholars claim Djinnlings are fractured pieces of ancient wish-gods, forever seeking new vessels for chaos. Local traders treat them with a mix of reverence and exasperation.

> “If it floats and giggles in yellow — bow, lie, or run. Your choice matters less than how funny it is.”
