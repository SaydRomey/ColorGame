> “Yes, yes, I made it. But I didn’t teach it to laugh.”



> The Razzflare wasn’t born. It burst into being — a byproduct of an unstable glamour brew during one of my more... dazzling accidents.



> They’re tricksters, sure, but my tricksters. Pink flames. Inverted shadows. Laughter that bends mirrors.
They mess with minds because they don’t understand shape. They shift, skip, and dance inside the cracks between what you see and what you think you see.



> One sang to me once. I woke up without eyebrows and a spellbook rewritten in jokes.



> If you hear giggling where there should be silence, it’s already too late.

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Razzflare Imp

Type:	Fey Trickster / Chaos Elemental
Threat Level:	⚠️ Moderate – Mentally Disruptive, Not Durable
First Emerged:	A failed glamour experiment under the Blooming Veil


Description:

These volatile little fey are the chaotic laughter of Myrrala made manifest. They move in unpredictable patterns, warp HUD elements, and cast minor illusion spells that disrupt combat flow.

Their fire is more confusion than flame — it burns consistency, not skin.

Hue Interaction:

Weak to harmonic pulses — music-based artifacts like the Razzmatazz Drum.

Can be stunned briefly with Aurelian Light Trick or Cobalt Static Dash.

Immune to fear, silence, or logic.


Behavior:

Dart in and out of combat, leaving trails of visual glitches (e.g. reversed movement, delayed input feedback).

Cast Illusion Bursts that momentarily replace the player’s form with that of nearby enemies or objects.

Upon defeat, may release a Glamour Pulse that causes one random effect (good or bad).


Known Weaknesses:

Vulnerable to rhythmic timing — striking them on beat cancels their illusion field.

Easily distracted by mirrored surfaces or echo chambers.

Temporarily grounded if struck while mid-laugh.


Notes:

Their laughter echoes in some dream-recordings. Scholars believe Razzflare Imps are drawn to places where reality is worn thin by joy or grief.
Despite their danger, some mages keep them as familiars — or try to.
