> I found her near the black coral stacks — bent over a journal that wouldn’t close.



> She wasn’t reading. She was remembering. But not her memories.



> The tide hadn’t taken her body. It had rewritten it.



> I watched as she lifted a page and pressed it to her face — and the text crawled into her skin.



> She spoke to no one. Only to the silence between waves.



> The words she writes aren’t in any script I’ve studied. They loop like water circling a drain.



> If she offers you a page… don’t read it. It writes you back.



> — Archive Note, marked “Untranslatable, but afraid.”

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Tideworn Apostle

Type:	Undead Scribe / Cursed Seer
Threat Level:	⚠️ Moderate–High – Magic Disruption & Field Control
First Emerged:	After the Drowning of Whispering Bay


Description:

Once a scholar of Zaffran’s tidal scriptures, the Tideworn Apostle attempted to decipher a storm-written grimoire beneath the reef’s trench. She returned wordless — but writing.

Now a vessel for drowned knowledge, she seeks only to silence voices… starting with yours.

Hue Interaction:

Her ink-runes scatter targeting reticules and miscast bound spells.

Cobalt’s Mind Echo can re-stabilize spell structure when cast near her active runes.

Weak to fire and light — especially when wielded through Hue-enhanced relics like the Cerulean Cloak.


Behavior:

Encounters begin with her inking the field — casting storm sigils that corrupt area-of-effect behavior.

Attack cycle:

Inkbind Glyph – roots players in storm-writing zones unless dodged.

Tidal Silence – disables player spellcasting briefly.

Scroll Bloom – summons a swarm of glowing script pages to obscure vision.



Known Weaknesses:

Fire magic burns her runes, briefly exposing her true position.

Interrupted if her floating pages are shattered before her chant completes.

Particularly vulnerable when caught between contradictory Hue pulses (e.g., Crimson + Cobalt echoes).


Notes:

Legends say she once held the “Codex of the Last Drown,” a book that only writes in storms.

Zaffran sailors believe if you dream of her, you’ve already forgotten something you swore never to.
