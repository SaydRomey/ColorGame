</div>A hidden, endgame-only encounter — The Seventh Hue is not a creature but a contradiction. It exists outside the spectrum and beyond remembrance. If you find it, you've already chosen wrong — or maybe right.

Bestiary Entry

Name: The Seventh Hue
Type: Forgotten Antithesis / Hue Paradox
Threat Level: ⚠️⚠️ Extreme – Optional Meta-Encounter
First Emerged: Behind sealed prism gates unlocked by full riddle solutions


---

Description:

An anomaly wrapped in shadowlight. Its form cannot be described — its edges blur the longer you look. It counters your essence: inverts your stats, defies your build, and names what you've tried not to become. A hue that does not belong.


---

Hue Interaction:

Nullifies all active hues on contact.

Forces the player into a reversed state: strengths become weaknesses; chosen affinities invert.



---

Behavior:

Appears only if you solve five or more Nullshade prism riddles without error.

Opens combat by stripping your HUD and fading the world to monochrome.

Uses "Unname" attacks — which erase traits, stat modifiers, or emotional cues.

Speaks only in reflection — its voice is yours, distorted.



---

Known Weaknesses:

Only defeated by confronting a final player-typed truth prompt during combat’s midpoint.

Certain dialogue choices from The Blooming Veil or Auralith echo as resistance.

Use of “Silent Hue” alignment temporarily reveals its true form.



---

Notes:

If defeated, unlocks Optional Dialogue Before Final Boss:
"What if the Prism was wrong?"

If spared, leaves behind a black shard that pulses between names never chosen.

Adds entry to Hue Archive: “The Forbidden Color.”
