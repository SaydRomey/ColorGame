> "There is a scream in Vireya that never ends. It circles the same word. The same wound. Over and over again."



> "The Crimson Echo is not a ghost — it's a loop. A memory caught in the final moments of a duel, so loud and furious that it tore itself free of death. Each one is different, shaped by a fallen warrior’s last strike, last scream, last regret. Some lash out with broken spears. Others parry shadows long gone. But all of them… remember the blade."



> "They react only when challenged — a look, a drawn weapon, a step into a circle scorched into the ground. Once provoked, the duel begins. And until the pattern is broken — or the echo is silenced — it will never end."



> — Vellidra, two days before she vanished in the Arena of Sighs

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Crimson Echo

Type:	Spectral Duelist / Memory Construct
Threat Level:	⚠️ High – Adaptive Combatant
First Emerged:	Post-War of Cinders, first recorded in Ember Pits


Description:

A Crimson Echo is the lingering combat memory of a warrior who died mid-duel, their rage and discipline imprinted on the battlefield itself. These echoes manifest when triggered — hovering apparitions that flawlessly mirror the final moves that defined their lives. Their weapons are ghost-steel and their movements eerily perfect, sharpened by eternity.

Hue Interaction:

Copies the last offensive ability used on it (including hue-bound attacks) and reuses it within moments.

Vulnerable to Cobalt or Violet anti-loop magic (e.g., time-slow, echo disrupt).

Immune to direct memory manipulation — but can be tricked by illusion-based stutters or false rhythm.


Behavior:

Activates only when a duel zone is entered or eye contact is made.

Attacks with increasing aggression each time its pattern is interrupted.

Disappears if ignored for long enough, but reappears on repeat visits.


Known Weaknesses:

Rhythm-breaking actions (e.g., sudden pauses, feints) can momentarily unbalance its loop.

Crumbles to silence-based spells (muting both sound and ability reuse).

Temporarily resets if hit by an unremembered action (e.g., non-hue environmental hazard).


Notes:

Some Crimson Echoes whisper the name of the one who killed them. Others whisper the name of the one they couldn’t. Skilled duelists claim they’ve learned new techniques simply by surviving a full cycle. Many others never finish the pattern.
