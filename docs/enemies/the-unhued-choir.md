  <i>"When they sing, the world forgets how to breathe."</i><br><br>
</div>A swirling constellation of childlike figures, their mouths unmoving yet filled with endless song. Their melody does not comfort — it unravels. Born in the wake of the Prism’s fracture, they echo its loss not with rage, but with perfect, merciless harmony.

> “It wasn’t that they were children. Not really. Just the shape sorrow took that day.”
“They sang like they knew what came next — like they remembered silence being born.”
“When I tried to speak, they hummed it away. My thoughts turned to fog. My spells turned to noise.”
“Each voice sang in a hue we buried. And when the last note faded… so did color.”

📘 Bestiary Entry

Name: The Unhued Choir
Type: Sound-Based Null Entity / Echo Construct
Threat Level: ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Critical – Appears in endgame or high Echo instability zones
First Emerged: After the Dirge of Prismfall, during Nullshade Emergence


---

Description:

Clustered specters shaped like children, hovering in loose orbit around a central absence — a void that pulses with each note. Their robes shimmer between hues briefly, only to fade gray as they sing.

They do not attack in the traditional sense. Their song unmakes. Sound becomes silence. Light becomes blur. The world becomes hard to hold onto.


---

Encounter Conditions:

Often found in Echo Collapse zones or guarding Nullshade altars.

May emerge from failed “Hue Alignment” puzzles or during emotional memory sequences.



---

Mechanics:

Dirge Pulse: Pulsing soundwave that disrupts the player’s UI — abilities grey out, HUD shifts erratically, inputs may invert.

Harmony Lock: If three or more Choir fragments harmonize, the player is frozen in place for 3 seconds — only broken by specific sound relics.

Dissonant Reflection: Copies the player’s last three spell inputs and returns them as unstable echoes (harmful illusions).



---

Hue Interaction:

Vulnerable to sonic-based spells, or relics tied to truthful sound (e.g., Verdant Tuning Fork, Yellow Radiant Chime).

Silenced only by using Color Sigils tied to the Order the player has chosen the fewest times.

Each fragment represents a lost hue — targeting them in their “resonant color moment” makes them vulnerable briefly.



---

Known Weaknesses:

If all members of the Choir are silenced in hue-order reverse (V → R), they disperse permanently.

A Mirrorshard Lens can reveal which Choir member is closest to resonance.

Using the player’s own recorded sound cue (via Memory Echo Recordings) can trigger a cancel loop.



---

Notes:

Choir fragments whisper faintly even after defeat — their echoes may be heard near important player decisions.

Some NPCs (e.g., the Isabelline Widow or Bistre Archivist) may reference hearing “child-song” in high Nullshade zones.

It is rumored that if all Choir fragments are defeated without taking damage, an ancient line of the Prismara’s hymn is restored — granting temporary “Uncolor” immunity.
