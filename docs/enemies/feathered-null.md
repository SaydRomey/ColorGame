> It didn’t fall.
The sky simply stopped lifting it.



> When the Prism cracked, there were angels of color — fragments given shape by grief and wind. This was one.



> The Feathered Null was born not in flight, but in forgetting how flight felt.



> Its wings bear no color. Its voice no echo. It moves where the wind used to be.



> Glaucous said it hovered outside her cliffs for three nights, silent — not a threat. Just watching. Measuring.



> And when it left… the storm forgot how to speak for a day.



> We believe it is not hostile. But we are not sure it remembers how to be kind.

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Feathered Null

Type:	Colorless Entity / Anti-Storm Apparition
Threat Level:	⚠️ Moderate – Traversal & Hue Suppression
First Emerged:	During the Dimming of the Third Gale


Description:

A rare Nullborne being shaped by stillness itself. The Feathered Null hovers in Iriseld’s upper strata, its presence silencing the winds and draining the storm's will.

More melancholic than malevolent, it exerts passive denial of momentum — anchoring what should soar.

Hue Interaction:

Suppresses Hue-based traversal abilities (gliding, storm-riding) within a radius.

Bound colors dim when in its aura; affects Crimson surge and Cobalt reaction timing.

Temporarily disrupted by Verdant Skygrowth, which restores buoyancy nearby.


Behavior:

Does not pursue. It drifts.

Engages only when provoked or approached during a storm ritual.

Behavior cycle:

Null Pulse – disables midair movement for several seconds.

Wing Veil – conceals its position in a dome of pale wind.

Echo Stillness – causes a silence field that interrupts dialogue and spellcasting.



Known Weaknesses:

Momentarily repelled by sky-sound (e.g., storm chimes, flute melodies).

Suffers minor instability if trapped in a triangulation of multiple hues (player + relic + echo site).

Only vulnerable during emotive wind surges triggered by memory sequences.


Notes:

The Glaucous Wing claims this creature is “a hymn never sung.”

Cannot be bound, named, or remembered by normal means — journals written near it lose ink.
