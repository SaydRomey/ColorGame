"It was once a harmony. Now it's a lesson in silence."

A drifting chorus of broken-hue figures — childlike, 
luminescent silhouettes whose song isn't heard, but seen.  
Each voice steals a color from the world, slowly reducing it to gray.
-->

Not born, but refracted from the aftermath of broken harmony, 
the Shatterglass Choir appears as a clutch of childlike silhouettes floating above the prism-cracked void.  
Each sings in a frequency tuned to a hue that no longer belongs to them.

## Lore Entry

<details><summary>See Shatterglass Choir Lore Entry</summary>

### Lore Entry: Torn page from “Echoes of a Prism Lost” by the Bistre Archivist

> "They weren’t always like this. 
> Once, they were singers of balance — prism children born to echo each hue as it rose."

> "But when the Core fractured, their voices were scattered. 
> Now they harmonize nothing — only absence."

> "The closer you get, the harder it is to hear yourself think. 
> They hum in broken ROYGBV — and if you answer out of order, 
> they don’t stop singing. They erase."

> "Only by silencing them in reverse — from red to violet, into gray — can their song be unsung."

<!--
### Lore Entry: Memory echo from a broken monolith, encoded in light.
> "They used to sing light into form. A gift. A foundation."  
> "Then the Prism cracked, and their harmonies became wounds."  
> "Each voice a memory — each harmony a removal."  
> "I watched them sing away blue… and my name with it."

### Description:  
A ring of levitating figures, semi-transparent, each with a glowing shard where a heart might be.  
As they chant, the environment begins to desaturate 
— eventually rendering the screen grayscale and disabling the Hue HUD.

They do not physically attack — but their chant undoes the world around them.

<!--
### Description:
Floating, translucent children with color-fractured outlines.  
They drift in small flocks and hum a nonverbal chord that literally pulls color out of the screen 
— as each sings, a hue fades from the player’s UI, effects, and world detail.
-->

---

### Hue Interaction:
- Each choir member sings a corrupted hue-tone (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet).
- Attacking them in the wrong hue strengthens their song.
- Silence is a mechanic: standing still or sheathing all hue-gear for 5 seconds interrupts the chant.

<!--
- Each individual Choir Wraith is tied to a specific hue (e.g., Red, Green, etc.).
- Must be silenced in the correct reverse color order (V→I→B→G→Y→O→R) to avoid full desaturation.
-->

---

### Behavior:
- Circle slowly outward around key lore items or boss arena gates.
- Sing in synchronized pulses — each pulse drains color and weakens nearby artifacts.
- If left unchecked, the game UI fades entirely for a full minute.

<!--
### Behavior:
- Passive at first, humming slowly. Their presence dims saturation gradually.
- When provoked, enter dissonant state — pulsing light-sound waves that debuff hue abilities.
- Reacts strongly to sound-based or emotion-tuned spells.
-->

---

### Known Weaknesses:
- Must be defeated in order of spectrum reversal: Violet → Blue → Green → Yellow → Orange → Red.
- If attacked out of order, they regenerate and double in volume.
- Purple/Violet Glamour Pulse resets the song progression if player becomes overwhelmed.
- Nullroot exposure nearby can silence one choir member temporarily.

<!--
### Known Weaknesses:
- Yellow and Violet hues disrupt their harmony most effectively.
- AoE silence spells prevent further color loss.
- Holding or activating lore items (especially music-based or mnemonic tools) stuns them briefly.
-->

### Notes:  
Occasionally sing snatches of your choices, warping phrases like: 
“You chose… silence,” or “Color was never yours to hold.”

Killing them all restores color to the region for a short time 
— enough to access sealed memory pools.

<!--
### Notes:
Letting them complete a full song causes the player’s screen to go fully grayscale 
until a memory puzzle is solved or choir is dispersed.

Choirs always reform near major choice events or reflection gates.
