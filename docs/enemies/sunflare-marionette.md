Lore Entry: From “Songs of the Marion Shrine,” a forbidden playbill burned at the Aureolin Temple> "They said the dancer was too beautiful to cast a shadow. So the sun made one — and gave it strings."



> "She was made of warmth and wire. A court doll forged for devotion. Her dance was a prayer. Her silence, a punishment."



> "One high noon, she stopped spinning. And the temple shadows lengthened for the first time in a hundred years."



> "Now she dances alone, untethered and unwatched. But the beams remember — and burn those who turn away."

Bestiary Entry

Name: Sunflare Marionette
Type: Construct / Solar Puppet
Threat Level: ⚠️ Moderate – High threat in bright open spaces
First Emerged: Believed to have been a ceremonial guardian of the Aureolin Courts, animated by forgotten rites of sun devotion


---

Description:
Glasslike humanoid figure suspended by searing filaments of sunlight. Limbs are hollow porcelain, reinforced with gold tracery. Its joints flicker with sunbursts as it pirouettes across battlefield mirages.


---

Hue Interaction:

Aurelian spells energize it; damaging it with Yellow hues causes it to emit healing waves for itself

Disrupted by Violet illusions and smoke/sand-based concealment (breaks beam threads)

Weakens in heavy cloud or artificial shade



---

Behavior:

“Sunline Steps” mark healing zones under solar focus; it dances between them

Uses ribbon-lash attacks to slice light-bound enemies

Will enter “Solar Bloom” state at 50% health: emits flares that detonate if not dodged in rhythm with her gestures

Can teleport via reflected surfaces during battle



---

Known Weaknesses:

Use shadow-creating terrain or artifacts to sever solar tethers

Cobalt’s Mind Echo or illusions can stagger it mid-spin

Highly vulnerable when caught without light for more than 10 seconds



---

Notes:
Ancient performance scrolls suggest the Marionette was once a celebrant — not a killer. Some dancers in Eburnea still perform her final dance at dusk, praying to blind the sun just long enough to forget their debts.

> “If you step into the spotlight… be sure you’re ready to bow.”
