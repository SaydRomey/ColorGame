Bestiary Entry

Name: Tapestry Watcher (Nullshade Variant)
Type: Regret Construct / Decision Echo
Threat Level: ⚠️ High — Metaphysical Disruptor
First Emerged: Phase echo bleed near Core Wound's south ridge


---

Description:

Each Nullshade variant of the Tapestry Watcher appears mid-animation — flickering, distorted, always mid-threading or mid-turn. They do not speak, but the environment around them whispers dialogue choices you never made, twisting the player's perception.


---

Hue Interaction:

Immune to color-aligned spells — reacts only to anti-aligned or unselected hues.

Glows when within range of unfulfilled side quests or unused dialogue trees.



---

Behavior:

Appears in mirrored paths or failed puzzles.

Paralyzes the player momentarily with threads of “missing memory” — visuals from dialogue branches never taken.

Will teleport behind the player if they ignore a manifested regret.



---

Known Weaknesses:

Can be defeated only by rewriting: through new decisions at reflection altars.

If engaged while carrying a Prism Archive Key, allows for one skipped regret to be resolved retroactively.

Silence spells pause its animation; Bistre Lantern shows its original Auralith form for a moment.



---

Notes:

If defeated in all its variants, unlocks the full tapestry mural in Nullshade’s archive vault — a visual display of the player’s total unchosen truths.

Final Watcher, if spared, leaves behind a whisper: “The next you may still choose better.”
