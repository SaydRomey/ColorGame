Semi-liquid form constantly shifting between water and mist.  
Glassy eyes reflect scenes from your past as it circles.  
Its body pulses with flickers of lightning and ghosted memory runes.

> It didn‚Äôt swim like a beast. 
> It flowed ‚Äî like guilt sliding back into the sea.

> We thought it was just current and coil, some strange tide-magic.

## Bestiary Entry
Name:	Abyssal Current  
Type:	Elemental Serpent / Memory-Water Construct  
Threat Level:	‚ö†Ô∏è High ‚Äì Emotional and Mechanic Drain  
First Emerged:	After the Submergence of the Azure Tithes  

### Description:
A haunting creature formed from stormwater soaked with memory magic.  
The Abyssal Current swims through Iriseld‚Äôs reef-cloaked coves and sky-reflected shallows, 
appearing only during mist or moonlight.

It does not kill by force ‚Äî it slowly overwhelms players with their own unresolved echoes, 
draining stored memory charges used for buffs, progression, and spell recall.

### Hue Interaction:
- Drawn to Cobalt-bound players, especially those carrying Mind Echo fragments.
- Weakens color-boosted passives by sapping memory charges when nearby.
- Can be briefly banished using a Zaffre Vial, which binds its swirling tide-form to glass.

### Behavior:
- Shifts between liquid and vapor: mist-form is harder to track but cannot attack.
- Only fully manifests when it "locks" onto a buried memory ‚Äî player hesitation or lore zone trigger.
- Drains player clarity (passive mental buffs) during long exposure.

### Known Weaknesses:
- Vulnerable to sonic pulse disruption (e.g., Cobalt‚Äôs Mind Echo).
- Avoid direct stare ‚Äî doing so triggers Memory Stir, revealing emotional visions that slow movement or invert controls.
- Enraged if its own memory reflections are shattered (e.g., mirrored terrain or echo crystals broken near it).

### Notes:

Some say the Current is not one being but many regrets fused into fluid thought.

The Zaffre Glasswright once tried to bottle part of one. The glass fogged forever.
