> "I knelt to gather dreampetals—careful, reverent, as my grandmother taught me. The blooms were warm from the sun, soft, still. Then the ground… breathed."



> "I felt it—not just the movement, but the hunger. A sudden pull, my satchel gone, then a blur of blossoms spiraling into the underbrush. The flowers weren’t flowers. They were scales. And beneath them, rows of teeth."



> "I’ve seen its path since—empty patches where no insects hum, no roots dare grow. It glides just beneath the surface, waiting. Watching. Camouflaged not in earth, but in beauty."



> "The forest doesn’t warn of it. It lets it be. Maybe because it’s not a monster to the woods… just another bloom that bites."

Name:	Fangbloom Wyrm

Type:	Camouflaged Serpent / Floral Predator
Threat Level:	⚠️ High – Lethal on First Encounter
First Emerged:	Post-Shattering Era


Description:

The Fangbloom Wyrm is a serpentine creature that disguises itself among Huevale’s lush floral beds. Its outer layers mimic blooming flowers and soft moss, concealing a coiled predator beneath. Once prey disturbs the area, the petals peel back, revealing a maw lined with hooked, chlorophyll-coated fangs.

Hue Interaction:

Immune to visual detection without specialized means (e.g., Skobeloff Lens, Echo spells).

Drawn to heat and motion more than hue, though will prioritize highly Hue-bound individuals.

Petal-camouflage can absorb minor Verdant or Violet hue pulses, rendering some scans ineffective.


Behavior:

Lies in wait beneath shallow rootbeds or floral clearings.

Strikes with immense speed, often dragging prey underground or into a tangle trap.

Will retreat if wounded, leaving behind severed petals or trail fragments to mislead pursuit.


Known Weaknesses:

Vulnerable to Echo-based detection (Cobalt or Earthen), which reveals its true shape.

Sonic pulses disorient its sensory vines, delaying its strike reaction.

Particularly sensitive to crushing damage, which bypasses its floral armor.


Notes:

The Wyrm’s petals are sometimes found scattered after an encounter—still glowing faintly, still warm. Huevale healers claim these remnants hum softly when held, repeating the last heartbeat of whatever the Wyrm consumed.
