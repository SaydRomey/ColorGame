> “We never finished writing it. So it kept writing itself.”



> The Glittering Grimoire was once a journal — empty, waiting to be filled by a young mage. But as she grew uncertain, it began writing her instead.



> Each time she chose not to cast a spell — the book remembered. Each secret withheld, each fear unspoken — the book listened.



> When the library fell, the Grimoire vanished into Myrrala’s winds. Now it drifts alone, seeking unfinished stories and half-cast spells.



> It opens only to reflect you.



> If it begins to write before you speak… run.

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Glittering Grimoire

Type:	Enchanted Spellbook / Echo-Wraith
Threat Level:	⚠️ Medium – Unpredictable Spellcaster
First Emerged:	After the Descent of the Violet Archive


Description:

A living tome of forgotten choices and echo spells. Glows faintly with past interactions — its pages reflect your spell usage history and counter accordingly.

The Grimoire never speaks. It lets your own past magic do the talking.

Hue Interaction:

Copies spells cast using Cobalt or Aurelian hues with high accuracy.

Disoriented by Violet’s Illusion Clone — cannot distinguish mimic from caster.

Immune to direct charm; vulnerable to feedback loops (e.g. looped illusions, memory echoes).


Behavior:

Begins battle closed — then snaps open with a gasp when you attack.

Selects from player’s previously used spells (past encounters, even region-specific).

Uses Ink Trail to confuse visual effects, and Runic Pulse that inverts spell directions.


Known Weaknesses:

Pages are fragile during page-turning animation — hit then to break a spell loop.

If hit while it's “rewriting,” the book suffers a Truth Tear and becomes stunned.

Defeated more easily when attacked with non-spell damage (e.g. melee, environmental).


Notes:

On death, drops Unwritten Page, which can be bound to a spell to create a “ghost echo” — an auto-cast illusion of it that can act independently once per day.
Rare encounters may cause it to “remember” future player actions — causing strange feedback in later fights.
