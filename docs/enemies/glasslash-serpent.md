> “She loved him. He left her in fire.”



> "The story of the Glasslash begins, like many Vireyan things, with heartbreak. A betrayal at the mouth of a caldera. A fall. A scream. A woman too burned to die — and something waiting below."



> "What crawled out of that glass-blown crevice was not her. But it remembers her scream."



> "The serpent wears pain like armor. Each flick of its body cuts the world that made it. And when you strike it? It only remembers how to shatter better."



> "Some Embermaidens whisper that it is the weapon left behind by the first betrayal. That it still waits for an apology."

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Glasslash Serpent

Type:	Elemental Beast / Fragmented Flame Construct
Threat Level:	⚠️ High – Environmental Hazard & Reflexive Damage
First Emerged:	Molten Shardfall, Year of Fracture


Description:

The Glasslash Serpent slinks through molten flows and battlefield ruins alike, leaving razor tracks of volcanic shrapnel behind. Its body is formed of sharp obsidian plates that reflect distorted images, confusing motion and depth. When threatened, it explodes outward — not dying, but shedding part of itself to maim.

Hue Interaction:

Resonates negatively with Crimson — absorbing heat and increasing movement speed.

Exposes its true body when hit with Cobalt sound bursts or Violet prism fractures.

Immune to most bleed or decay effects — it has no flesh.


Behavior:

Prefers ambush tactics — hides in lava pools, sand drifts, or shattered rock beds.

Uses whip-like lunges followed by slithering retreats.

Every 3rd strike it takes causes a defensive shatter, creating damaging glass fields.


Known Weaknesses:

Vulnerable to vibration-based spells (e.g. seismic drums, ground pulse), which disrupt balance and expose its molten heart.

If shattered over cooled lava, fragments remain inert — allows safe pathing.

Momentarily stunned after “glass bloom” — when it erupts in full defense mode.


Notes:

Some desert clans wear shards from fallen Glasslashes as pendants — not for strength, but for memory. They say if you listen close, the glass still hums with the moment it broke. And it’s always the same note: regret.
