Trails mirror-shards through the air; footsteps echo a second too late.

Flickers unpredictably when struck — emits a shriek of reverse sound.

> I thought to trap a memory in cobalt, a kindness in solid light. But the wind here remembers grief too well, and the glass began to ache.



> The Echo was not what I captured. It was what I tried to forget — how I moved, how I reached, how I failed. It mimics the moment I last looked in the glass. That pain became recursive. It moved without me.



> Now it wanders the skyglass shelves, looping itself — a broken dance. I hear my own voice call out when it strikes.

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Glassborne Echo

Type:	Phantasmal Construct / Mirrorbound Wraith
Threat Level:	⚠️ High – Reactive and disorienting
First Emerged:	During the Stormglass Fracture, Post-Shattering


Description:

Forged accidentally by attempts to preserve memory in enchanted glass, the Glassborne Echo is not a ghost — it is the moment of remembrance, sharpened and untethered.

Its form reflects the player imperfectly, mirroring their recent movements in delayed mimicry. Striking one fractures its body, sending slivers of mirrored force in wide arcs.

Hue Interaction:

Resonates violently with Cobalt echoes and Mind-based magic.

Briefly stunned when surrounded by synchronized audio rhythms (wind chimes, harpstrings, Cerulean Cloak pulses).

Immune to illusion — it is one.


Behavior:

Loops player actions back at them with a time delay (mimics dashes, spells, jumps).

Trails mirror shards that apply “Reflection Wound” (any repeated action takes more damage).

Will vanish if reflected in more than one surface at once (dual mirrors or glass pool).


Known Weaknesses:

Vulnerable to sonic resonance and multi-angle light (e.g., Skyglass Prisms).

Avoid prolonged mimicry — stagger movement patterns to confuse it.

May flee if the player uses Payne’s Brush or displays a memory the Echo cannot interpret.


Notes:

Some say each Echo was born from a different regret — others claim they all share one memory: falling.

A rare few Echoes have been seen pausing… as if remembering something they wish they hadn’t.
