> "We named it Thornwrithe—an apt name for a beast whose presence turns peaceful glades into briar-choked traps overnight. I first encountered one after the Shattering, in the shadowed underbrush near Malachite Grove."



> "It moved faster than anything I'd ever seen, a blur of thorns and shadow, dragging vines in its wake that tangled and tore at our ankles. One warden tried to chase it down, driven by frustration rather than wisdom. He returned hours later, armor shredded, his skin marked by jagged lines of vine-dark scars. He never spoke clearly again—only muttered endlessly about roots under his skin."



> "This beast is no mere predator. It is the rage of the forest given form, swift and unforgiving, each thorn sharpened by forgotten grievances. Approach only if ready to fight—and prepared to bleed."



> — Xanadu Warden, Thornwood Patrol Logs, 5th Season After the Shattering



</details>Bestiary Entry

Name:	Thornwrithe Beast

Type:	Briar-Covered Beast / Fast Predator
Threat Level:	⚠️ High – Extremely dangerous when engaged directly
First Emerged:	Early Post-Shattering Era


Description:

The Thornwrithe Beast is a swift quadruped encased in dense, thorny briars and vines that writhe continuously around its body. It moves silently and swiftly through Huevale's dense foliage, attacking prey in rapid, brutal ambushes. Each wound it inflicts quickly sprouts painful thorny growths, hampering its victim’s movements.

Hue Interaction:

Resistant to Verdant control; attempts to manipulate its vines cause violent backlash.

Leaves behind trails of entangling roots, heavily restricting mobility.

Becomes enraged by Crimson flame, increasing its aggression significantly.


Behavior:

Uses hit-and-run tactics, hiding and emerging unpredictably to confuse prey.

Patrols defined territories, fiercely defending its bramble-marked borders.

Shows particular hostility toward intruders damaging or burning forest areas.


Known Weaknesses:

Earthen decay spells can wither its protective vines, reducing its defense and mobility temporarily.

Vulnerable to sustained fire-based attacks (Crimson), though this temporarily boosts its aggression.

Sensitive to powerful sonic or vibration attacks that disrupt its coordination and briefly stun it.


Notes:

Victims who survive encounters with Thornwrithe Beasts often bear permanent marks—twisting scars that resemble thorned vines. Some believe these scars slowly grow, as though a lingering part of the beast remains embedded, feeding off memories of fear and pain.
