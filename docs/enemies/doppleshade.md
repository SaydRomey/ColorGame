> “Reflections should show truth. But in dreams, even mirrors lie kindly.”



> There are things that wear your face. Not out of malice — but because they don’t know their own anymore.



> The Doppelshade is not born. It is caught — a slip of intent, a lingering gesture you forgot you made. It waits in veil-thin mirrors, rehearsing your doubts until they can dance without you.



> I watched a traveler argue with theirs for hours. When I returned, only one walked away. I couldn't say who.



> They say the Thulian Court once kept a hall of mirrors where you could see every choice you didn’t make. That hall burned. But the reflections... didn’t die.



> If your reflection attacks first, it was never yours.



> — Scribed into the petals of a Liseran Lily, pressed between two illusion-stung pages.

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Doppelshade

Type:	Illusory Mimic / Mirrorborne Trickster
Threat Level:	⚠️ Variable – Based on player complexity
First Emerged:	Post-Shattering; earliest recorded in Myrrala


Description:

A self-propagating illusion created from unfulfilled choices, ego residue, and mirrorborne emotion.

Doppelshades form when lingering doubt is reflected too long in the Blooming Veil’s mirrorstones.
They mimic appearance, equipment, and behavioral tics — even mimicking spellcasting stutters or dodge habits.

They are never quite perfect. That’s their trap. That’s your warning.

Hue Interaction:

Weak to truth-bound light (Aurelian) and sound-based rhythm (Cobalt).

Immune to illusions unless constructed by the player using Violet (they can be "tricked back").

Reflected projectiles strike them for full damage if released with reversed timing.


Behavior:

Appears behind or near mirrors, often posing mid-gesture.

Opens with your most frequent spell or attack combo — but slightly early.

Adapts quickly: second encounter includes all choices made in first.


Known Weaknesses:

Temporarily stuns if caught in a Thulian Mirror beam or Heliotrope Band aura.

Becomes unstable when confronted by multiple dialogue-paths or player contradictions.


Notes:

Some say killing a Doppelshade removes a fear.
Others say it replaces one.
Fey scholars advise not to look into your reflection after — just in case it blinks when you don’t.
