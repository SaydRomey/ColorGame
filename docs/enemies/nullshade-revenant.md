🧠 Lore Entry

<details><summary>See Nullshade Revenant Lore Entry</summary>Excerpt from “Core-Walker's Notes, Vol. VII” – Anonymous Prismwalker

> “We found her kneeling at the edge of a Shatterglass Pool. Not praying. Not breathing. Just… remembering.”

“A crimson sash fluttered from one arm. A green tattoo pulsed beneath her cracked skin. Once, she was a hero of the Color War. Now, she barely casts a shadow.”

“When she rose, her eyes didn’t see us. They saw some place we weren’t. She moved through our attacks like they hadn’t happened yet.”

“Then she struck — and I forgot how to defend.”

“The Nullshade does not raise the dead. It reflects what it means to never have died right.”

📘 Bestiary Entry

Name: Nullshade Revenant
Type: Hue-Corrupted Undead / Memory Echo
Threat Level: ⚠️ High – Reality-distorting revenant
First Emerged: Nullshade Bloom, post-Prism Collapse


---

Description:

Once-alive figures from various Orders, their original hue still faintly flickering in their cloak seams or crystal bones. Their skin is cracked porcelain, leaking vaporized memory. Some hum old color chants. Others sob without tears.


---

Hue Interaction:

Cannot be aligned. Causes instability in the player’s current hue if struck or touched.

Enters phase-shift state when near strong hue magic, becoming invisible or displaced unless lit by:

Cobalt (Blue) reality-lock sigils

Yellow (Hope) illusions refracted through the Thulian Mirror

Violet dream-lensing (Glamour Pulse)




---

Behavior:

Wanders aimlessly until triggered by:

Player casting a hue spell near them.

Touching a Memory Echo shrine.

Saying a phrase tied to their former hue allegiance.


In combat:

Heavy, deliberate swings — infused with color-ghosts of old abilities.

Their attacks “corrupt” the player’s hue alignment temporarily (turning abilities gray or misaligned).

At 50% HP, they begin to teleport erratically, repeating your previous movements with lagging mimicry.




---

Known Weaknesses:

Must be lit by hue before becoming vulnerable: e.g., Blue Sigils, Lanterns, or truth-based illusions.

Cannot be silenced, but disrupted by lore items tied to their past self (e.g., Journal Fragments, Relic Sketches).

Prismwalker Shard glow pulses stronger near them — a clue to real-space alignment.



---

Notes:

Some Prismwalkers report “remembering” events they never lived after battling one.

The Bistre Archivist theorized they are “souls who fractured across hues too often — now trapped in the space between.”
