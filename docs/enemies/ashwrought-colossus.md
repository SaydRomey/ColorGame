Emits heat shockwaves that sap stamina and distort ranged attacks.

Its inner fire builds over time — overheat triggers explosive eruptions from its seams.

> “They told it the war was over. But no one ever said it loud enough.”



> "The Colossi were built for the War of Cinders — towering siege beasts, each housing dozens of embersmiths and war-priests inside. When the Prism broke, many fell silent. But a few kept walking. Not because they were commanded — but because they remembered being told never to stop."



> "This one — the Ashwrought — no longer holds a crew. It moves on scorched instinct alone. What thoughts it has are ember-born echoes trapped in its plates. It bellows old commands into the ashwind, its voice the groan of ancient gears."



> "I watched it pass once. It left prints glowing with coal for days after. No destination. Just motion. As if it’s still trying to breach a wall that no longer stands."

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Ashwrought Colossus

Type:	Siege Construct / Ember Machine
Threat Level:	⚠️ Very High – Area Denial and Stamina Drain
First Emerged:	War of Cinders (pre-Shattering), still active


Description:

The Ashwrought Colossus is a mobile siege engine left wandering the Ember Expanse, its molten core still aflame after centuries. Built from patchwork remnants of destroyed war machines, it is less a machine now and more a memory wrapped in metal. Its movements are slow but thunderous, and each step radiates unbearable heat.

Hue Interaction:

Absorbs Crimson energy, growing unstable — too much heat causes internal overload (creating a brief stun).

Cobalt mist or water-based hue temporarily cools its armor, weakening its strikes.

Immune to Verdant manipulation — plant magic scorches before contact.


Behavior:

Patrols former battlegrounds and abandoned fortresses, especially near ruined banners.

Engages intruders with sweeping heatwaves and molten punches.

Ignites terrain passively as it moves; fire persists unless neutralized.


Known Weaknesses:

Weak point: Exhaust vent in upper spine glows bright orange when overheating — exposed after 3 consecutive attacks.

Earthen “Memory Echo” spells can cause hesitation or stagger, if tied to specific war memories.

Vulnerable to sonic resonance or vibration-based attacks — disrupt internal furnace chambers.


Notes:

When felled, the Colossus collapses with a deep, sighing groan. Some players report hearing a single whispered name from within the cooling wreck — always different — as if it’s still trying to remember who it carried into war.
