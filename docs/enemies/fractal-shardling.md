Bestiary Entry

Name: Fractal Shardling
Type: Recursive Entity / Prism Construct
Threat Level: ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate ‚Üí Escalating
First Emerged: Post-Shattering Splinterfall

Description:

Appears as jagged crystal fragments rotating in impossible loops. Movement paths loop on invisible, recursive tethers. When struck, each Shardling splits into two smaller, faster versions, gaining speed and unpredictability.

This continues until their recursion limit is hit ‚Äî usually five generations. At that point, they collapse inward with a silent burst, altering terrain geometry or shifting level logic.


---

Hue Interaction:

Changes color slightly with each split ‚Äî mimics hue gradients but never fully displays them.

Immune to direct hue magic; however, light-based illusions (especially Yellow and Violet) delay their recursion.



---

Behavior:

Patrols fixed paths until disturbed.

Targets the last source of impact.

Each smaller version emits a fainter hum ‚Äî eventually becomes silent, but more dangerous.



---

Known Weaknesses:

Can be halted early with a perfectly timed sound burst (e.g., Echo Pulse).

Violet‚Äôs Glamour Pulse confuses their recursion, forcing false splits.

Reflecting their movement back into themselves using mirror terrain causes instant collapse.



---

Notes:

If more than five are allowed to split, level geometry around them may deform subtly ‚Äî floating platforms misalign, doors shift location.

Occasionally whisper math-like patterns ("One becomes two. Two becomes... error.") before collapsing.
