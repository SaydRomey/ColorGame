> “It is not justice. It is memory polished until it cuts.”



> The Vowkeepers were once truth-bound protectors of the Mirror Courts — warriors who could not lie, and who punished those who did.
When the Bloom fractured, so too did their clarity. Their mirrors no longer reflect truth — only promises made and broken.



> They appear where lies fester or where promises die — even small ones. Especially small ones.



> If you told someone you'd return and didn’t… if you said “I’ll protect you,” and failed… it remembers.



> And it will finish the sentence with a blade.



> — Thulian Emissary, “On the Nature of Promised Things”

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Thulian Vowkeeper

Type:	Crystalbound Knight / Sentient Oath Mirror
Threat Level:	⚠️⚠️ High – Emotionally Reactive Nemesis
First Emerged:	After the collapse of the Mirror Courts of Myrrala


Description:

A gleaming, faceted warrior from the lost Mirror Kingdom. Carries no banner — only the weight of what others failed to uphold.
Its speech is stolen from the player’s own dialogue history — phrases it twists into attacks.

Hue Interaction:

Empowered if the player has broken multiple dialogue-based choices or rejected questlines.

Pacified (briefly) by honest recollection via Violet’s Illusion Clone or Cobalt’s Mind Echo.

Immune to illusion-based misdirection — its blade slices through falsehood.


Behavior:

Begins combat by reciting a promise or dialogue the player once made — “You said you’d protect them.”

Uses Truth Slash, which reflects prior movement patterns in a delayed echo.

Counters healing spells with Oathburn: turns healing into minor damage if the player fled a vow-bound fight.


Known Weaknesses:

Vulnerable only during its “judgment pause” — when it hesitates after speaking a truth.

Can be confused by paradoxes: use opposing truth/lie dialogue back-to-back.

Severely weakened if shown a Thulian Mirror containing its own origin reflection.


Notes:

Some players report that defeating a Vowkeeper triggers an echo elsewhere — as if another has been freed from a guilt they didn’t know they carried.
Its crystal blade, once shattered, becomes the Fragment of Fulfillment, used to unlock hidden dialogue paths or rebind past decisions.
