Lore Entry: Extracted from a dust-bound scroll marked “THREADS OF UNRAVELING” – scribed by the Bistre Archivist> “The Ashweaver does not feed on blood. It feeds on recollection. Its web catches nothing but thought — and it is always hungry.”



> “To pass near its lair is to hear what you almost said. To step into its thread is to walk into the moment you most regret.”



> “One hunter once spoke of facing her own laughter — twisted and made venomous. Another saw their mother’s voice woven into the strands.”



> “Avoid narrow halls in the Isabelline Catacombs. Listen for whispers you’ve never spoken. And if you feel the chill of something watching… it already knows your secrets.”

Bestiary Entry

Name: Ashweaver Recluse
Type: Memory-Touched Arachnid Aberration
Threat Level: ⚠️⚠️ Moderate-High – Psychological and Environmental Hazard
First Emerged: Early Dimming Cycle – Rooted in the Vein-Crypt Glooms

Description:
A massive, gaunt spider with translucent limbs and a back coated in ash-laced silk. It moves with near-silence, hiding within deep, memory-choked corridors. Its webbing flickers faintly, alive with stolen thoughts.

Hue Interaction:

Violet-bound illusions confuse the Recluse, reflecting false memories.

Brown-bound players may identify safe threads by aligning past dialogue echoes.

Light or sound spells can disrupt web illusions but alert nearby husks.


Behavior:

Lays dense networks of memory-thread traps across key passageways.

When disturbed, triggers a “panic echo” — the player hears a cascade of whispers from past in-game choices.

May attempt to cocoon the player in suspended animation, locking them in a memory loop unless interrupted.


Known Weaknesses:

Sensitive to sonic dissonance and flash spells.

Memory Echo abilities reveal false or ensnaring threads.

Extremely territorial — will retreat if its web is collapsed in one move.


Notes:
Some say the Recluse was born when a seer’s unspoken regrets took form in the void between tombstones. Its silk is prized by soulbinders — but requires being harvested under silence, or risk weaving your own voice into it forever.
