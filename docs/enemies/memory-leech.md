> "They were first seen crawling from Shatterglass Pools — drawn to forgotten words and interrupted thoughts."



> "One latched onto me during a glyph alignment. For hours, I couldn’t recall what fire was. Only when I held my child’s drawing did the memory return."



> "Their hunger is specific: they consume the shape of memory. They feed on the scaffolding of identity."



> "To kill one is easy. To recover what it took is not."

Bestiary Entry

Name: Memory Leech
Type: Cognitive Parasite / HUD Saboteur
Threat Level: ⚠️ Moderate to High (depending on player memory reliance)
First Emerged: During the Prism’s collapse, amid the data loss storm


---

Description:

A wiry insect-like creature with limbs of glinting obsidian and a core that pulses like a heartbeat. When close, it emits a whispering hum — like your own thoughts turned alien.


---

Hue Interaction:

Highly resistant to logic- and pattern-based attacks (Blue); weak to memory-restoring items (e.g., Bistre Lantern).

Temporarily disoriented by Echo-based spells or full silence auras (Brown/Violet mix).



---

Behavior:

Charges the player erratically; attaches with a flash of static.

On successful latch, it causes:

Temporary loss of button prompts

Disabling of 1-2 equipped Hue abilities

UI distortion (flickering text, backward narration)


Can be knocked off by triggering a memory echo (e.g., stepping into a past scene reflection).



---

Known Weaknesses:

Repelled by memory artifacts (like the “Tethered Locket” or “Truth Echo Scroll”).

Fire-based AoE flushes them from stealth; they avoid direct sunlight or radiant zones.

Vulnerable when “full” — after stealing too many prompts, they slow down visibly.



---

Notes:

Rarely appear in groups, but the damage they do accumulates psychologically.

Defeating them restores lost prompts gradually — some may only return after interacting with a remembered NPC or shrine.

Nullshade survivors say, “If you hear yourself forget… run.”
