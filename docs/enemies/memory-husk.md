</div>A pale, translucent figure echoing your form, posture, and past choices. Its presence carries the uncanny familiarity of a half-remembered dream, or the mistake you never corrected.

Mimics a skill, artifact, or combat behavior the player previously used in Auralith or earlier zones.

Attacks with distorted animations of your moves — as though struggling to recall them fully.

Bestiary Entry

Name: Memory Husk
Type: Echoed Shade / Identity Wraith
Threat Level: ⚠️ Moderate – Potentially lethal if underestimated
First Emerged: Post-Shattering, near early alchemical fault-lines

Description:
The Memory Husk appears as a ghostly copy of the player, often in older equipment or casting long-abandoned spells. It inhabits places where the player has previously died, failed, or made significant decisions.

Hue Interaction:

Reacts to the hues the player has bound before.

Adapts to mimic combat rhythm based on equipped color.

Highly unstable when faced with conflicting past choices.


Behavior:

Mimics player movements with slight delay or error.

Changes attack pattern if player changes weapon mid-fight.

Mutters distorted fragments of the player’s past dialogue.


Known Weaknesses:

Temporarily pacified when the player performs an action they never used before.

Vulnerable to “Memory Echo” from the Earthen Bound hue.

Can be defeated by correctly replaying a sequence of past dialogue lines.


Notes:
Some Memory Husks whisper names of the player’s lost allies or reflect choices never taken. In rare cases, they drop “Faded Self” items — non-functional echoes of gear the player once wore.
