</div>A towering figure shrouded in torn veil-light, the Spectral Harvester appears not to punish—but to erase. It emerges from moments of neglect: puzzles failed, memories ignored, truths left unspoken. Its blade is not for flesh, but for the past.

> “I missed the glyph. Just one.”
“Didn’t say the right name. Didn’t speak the truth.”
“Then… the hum started. Like glass grinding through silk.”
“I saw them — not me, but the ones I could’ve been. And it swung.”

“My journal is gone. My name in the Archive turned blank. That… thing didn’t kill me. It unremembered me.”

📘 Bestiary Entry

Name: Spectral Harvester
Type: Memory-Execution Wraith / Nullshade Reaper
Threat Level: ⚠️⚠️ Very High – Appears only on significant player failure
First Emerged: After the First Prism Dissonance Event


---

Description:

Tall, cloaked entity with a shattered hue-scour blade — half-crystal, half-blacksteel. Its face is hidden behind a mirrored mask that shows distorted moments from the player’s journey.

Wields a scythe-like weapon with arcs of fractured color trailing behind it. Each step drags echoes of faded versions of the player through time-warped soil.


---

Trigger Conditions:

Appears if the player fails a Memory Echo segment, Nullshade prism riddle, or refuses to resolve a major lore prompt.

Spawns directly into the area — warping the environment subtly: sky darkens, color flickers, geometry buckles slightly.



---

Mechanics:

Memory Cleave: If it lands a hit, the player loses part of their map progress or recorded lore entries (temporarily suppressed).

Harvest Swing: Deletes a portion of active HUD (e.g., minimap, skill bar). Restores only after re-solving the triggering riddle.

Echo Banish: Calls forth spectral versions of NPCs the player failed to help, each whispering blame or confusion.



---

Hue Interaction:

Immune to hue magic unless it's cast with memory-infused relics (e.g., Bistre Lantern, Caput Mortuum Phylactery).

Weakened by Hue Reforge relics, which momentarily restore lost history or cancel its abilities.

Using a correct name from earlier lore allows the player to banish it early (one-use dialogue trigger).



---

Known Weaknesses:

Avoidable entirely by completing Echo segments correctly or resolving Nullshade riddles.

Vulnerable during “Frozen Memory” state — when it pauses to recall a version of you it cannot confirm.

Can be dispelled permanently by presenting a “True Memory” — an artifact you kept unchanged since Act I.



---

Notes:

Spectral Harvesters do not drop loot. They drop pages — torn from quests or codex entries you once held.

The Prismwalker’s own name may vanish from the title screen for one save file, until the Harvester is defeated or forgiven.

If allowed to land three full swings: the player forgets a key past choice (locked until a lore artifact is used to remember).
