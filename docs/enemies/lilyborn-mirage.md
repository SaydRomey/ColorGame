Speaks in looped fragments of previous conversations.

Standing too close causes dialogue boxes to replay — even if they never happened.

> They don’t lie.
They don’t have to.



> The lilies remember what was said — or what was meant — or maybe just what we wished we said.



> These things bloom when emotion lingers too long in one place. They drink from forgotten farewells and root into questions left unanswered.



> I spoke to one once. Or maybe it spoke to me. It asked what I feared most. I told it. Then I told it again. And again. And again.



> When I came to, the petals had grown teeth. And I was bleeding memory.

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Lilyborn Mirage

Type:	Dream-Construct / Illusory Interrogator
Threat Level:	⚠️ Moderate – Cognitive Disruption
First Emerged:	During the Bloomwake Season in Myrrala


Description:

An elegant dream-entity birthed from twilight lilies that have rooted in regret. It does not fight with force — it unravels by asking.

The Mirage loops scenes or lines the player has heard before, layering them until choice becomes confusion.
Some of its illusions are true. Some are almost true. Some are yours.

It casts questions mid-fight, and answering the wrong way replays the action — with damage.

Hue Interaction:

Weak to pattern disruption via Cobalt’s Mind Echo or Violet’s Glamour Pulse.

Aurelian’s Radiant Echo reveals which "memories" are false.

Verdant tools like Skygrowth Seed can ground its mist temporarily.


Behavior:

Opens with a shimmerburst that reverses dialogue choices.

Repeats 3–5 second memory loops that affect hitboxes and terrain.

Casts “Memory Bloom” — an AoE illusion that causes the player to speak involuntarily, re-triggering decision points.


Known Weaknesses:

Interrupted by call-and-response magic (e.g., Razzmatazz Drum).

Becomes tangible during the final beat of a rhythmic cycle (watch the petals sway).

Using the Thulian Mirror during combat reveals which line it's about to speak — preempting the loop.


Notes:

A rare scholar wrote:

> “The lily only lies if you ask it to bloom.”
That scroll ends with a sentence that trails off… repeating itself… again… and again…
