> We heard it before we saw it — not a bark, but a pressure drop.
The air folded in half. Then it struck.



> My guide called it a “stormwrit,” a hound scribed by lightning itself.
It doesn’t follow you. It finishes thoughts you haven’t had yet.



> One moment it was chasing the birds above us — the next, it was inside my arcshield.
And when it howled, something behind my eyes shattered.



> I left the cliffs that day. My journal didn’t.

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Stormwrit Hound

Type:	Lightning Beast / Elemental Predator
Threat Level:	⚠️ High – Fast, Unpredictable, Anti-Casting
First Emerged:	During the Tempest Surge following the Shattering


Description:

Forged in a lightning rift during the great Iriseld storms, the Stormwrit Hound is less a beast than a sentient arc of electrical fury.
It appears as if drawn in sky-ink: wires twitching, plasma limbs jittering between now and next.

This predator doesn’t stalk. It interrupts — appearing mid-cast, mid-jump, or mid-thought to snap a moment in half.

Hue Interaction:

Disrupts spell channeling, especially Cobalt-based spells tied to storm or rhythm.

At high static charge, briefly disables Color Binding UI.

Can be slowed if surrounded by harmonic resonance (instruments, echo chimes, etc.).


Behavior:

Paces cliff edges until it senses fast movement or charged spell buildup.

Upon activation:

Leaps between lightning nodes (marked skyglass spikes or copper relays).

Uses Flash-Fang Lunge: teleports, hits, and leaves a static copy for 2s.

Occasionally howls — this stuns rhythm-based abilities and lowers visibility (storm flash).



Known Weaknesses:

Susceptible to Wind-grounding relics and Cerulean Cloak effects.

Harmonic instruments (e.g., skybell chimes or glass flutes) distort its targeting.

Momentarily pacified if its own lightning arc is reflected (e.g., with a Payne’s Prism Pane or storm mirror).


Notes:

Some monks claim the Stormwrit Hounds carry messages between lightning gods — or are the messages.

One relic hunter’s log simply said: “Don’t blink during thunder.”
