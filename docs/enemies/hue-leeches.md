Perfect — here’s the full-format bestiary entry for the first unbound creature: Hue Leeches, now slotted as a cross-regional (multi-hue) ambient threat.

They drift lazily until a hue is activated — then swarm to drain it from you.

🧠 Lore Entry

<details><summary>See Hue Leeches Lore Entry</summary>Excerpt from "Drifting Parasites of the Huefold Realms" by Ashar of Huevale

> "At first, I mistook them for droplets of oil falling upward — mesmerizing, harmless. But when I cast even the simplest burst of Crimson, they surged like starving children."

"One latched onto my back, and the world dimmed. My fire fizzled to ash. My pulse slowed. In that moment, I understood — they feed not on color… but on intention."

"Hue Leeches do not kill. They erase. What you meant to do fades. What you believed, dulls. I survived by flashing a prism shard in their midst — they scattered, furious, luminous."

"They taught me the cruelest truth: color is trust. And they are doubt incarnate."

📘 Bestiary Entry

Name: Hue Leeches
Type: Color-Parasitic Aberration
Threat Level: ⚠️ Minor (but disruptive in swarms)
First Emerged: Post-Prism Fracture


---

Description:

Hue Leeches resemble globs of suspended ink, tinged with glimmering rainbow pulses. They drift in the air or hover near hue-aligned shrines, drawn to magic or activated color states.

When they latch onto the player, they drain a hue, causing equipped abilities to “gray out” for several seconds, rendering them unusable.


---

Hue Interaction:

Target Active Hues: Prefer targets with recently activated spells or abilities.

Neutral to physical presence, but highly reactive to visual spell cues or aura pulses.

Turn gray and inert when exposed to complete hue-suppression fields (e.g., Nullshade auras or unaligned relics).



---

Behavior:

Spawn in swarms near prism fractures, old altars, or failed transmutation zones.

Linger passively until provoked by hue use.

Attempt to escape if stunned or flashed with high-contrast light bursts.



---

Known Weaknesses:

Area-of-effect bursts (especially of non-hue damage types, e.g., shockwaves, force spells).

Vulnerable to Prism Flash Talismans, which disrupt their hue tethering.

Can be stunned with mirror-angled light, then popped like bubbles.



---

Notes:

Hue Leeches are not bound to one realm. They are the drifting parasites of a broken system — showing up wherever color falters or bleeds.

Some archivists believe they evolved from the Prism’s tears… others say they are what remains of unfinished hues — the ones never chosen.
