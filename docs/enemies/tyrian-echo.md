  <h3>Tyrian Echo</h3>
  <i>Not a person. A memory repeating itself into violence.</i><br>

A shimmering humanoid outline, locked in flickering animation loops.

Its movements are beautiful, fluid — and utterly unbreakable.  
It fights like a dancer remembering the steps, even as the music has long stopped.

### Recovered field note – “Echoes Along the Violet Scar” by the Prismwalker Serael

> "We found her in the ruins where Violet turned back Crimson. 
> She moved before we saw her. 
> Not teleportation — just… already there."

> "I called out, thinking her one of the Order.   > She paused mid-swing, as if hearing something 
> — then completed the motion."

> "She fought like a dream — graceful, haunting, wrong.  
> Spells twisted between Crimson blades and Violet illusions, but not cleanly.  
> Like a child coloring between blood and reverie."

> "When I struck her, she shattered into fragments of me.  
> Things I’d said in anger. Places I didn’t go.  
> People I could have saved."

> "We left that ruin. She stayed behind.  
> Fighting the memory we brought with us."

## Bestiary Entry
Name: Tyrian Echo  
Type: Spectral Memory Construct  
Threat Level: ⚠️ Moderate – Emotionally volatile, disorients combat rhythm  
First Emerged: Post-Color War Scarring

---

### Description:

Tyrian Echo manifests as a blurred, violet-crimson silhouette 
— female in form, cloaked in flickering ribbons of broken hue.  
She stutters through battle patterns of a long-dead warrior, 
always finishing attacks she never begins.

Her body glitches between swordplay and spellcasting, sometimes mid-animation.

---

### Hue Interaction:
- Tied directly to Crimson (willpower, wrath) and Violet (dream, memory).
- Mimics player attacks if emotionally resonant (e.g., dialogue trees about vengeance or failure).
- Vulnerable to Brown (truth/memory anchors) and Yellow (disruption/light).

---

### Behavior:
- Appears near color-war memorials, ruined battlegrounds, or memory glyphs.
- Engages without provocation if the player has committed a key regret (tracked via world-state flags).
- Occasionally pauses mid-battle, repeating old dialogue from other characters — none of whom are present.

---

### Known Weaknesses:
- Loses form briefly when exposed to Echo Pulse or Truth Sigils.
- Disrupted by reframing dialogue (“I forgive them,” “That wasn’t me,” etc.).
- Final phase collapses if player stands still during her final loop.

---

### Notes:

Tyrian Echo may appear multiple times, each instance slightly different 
— replaying a different failure or memory based on the player’s world-state.

Some Archivists theorize she was once real.  
Others argue she is simply what war feels like… after it ends.
