Lore Entry: Fragment from “Sands Untrue,” journal of Fulvous Hunter Jaxem Kresh> “They told me it was a heat shimmer. That you could outrun it.”



> “But the ground wasn’t hot. It was hollow. The shimmer twisted — like glass half-melted into water.”



> “Then the dune rose and I saw the teeth.”



> “You don’t kill a Mirrorthirst. You distract it with reflections of yourself and pray the real you gets away.”

Bestiary Entry

Name: Mirrorthirst Wyrm
Type: Mirage Predator / Illusory Leviathan
Threat Level: ⚠️ High – Terrain-dependent ambusher
First Emerged: Post-Shattering; believed to have formed when mirage illusions solidified during a solar collapse event


---

Description:
An immense serpentine creature, semi-transparent and refracting like broken glass submerged in water. It leaves undulating shimmer trails that pulse with radiant heat and light distortion.


---

Hue Interaction:

Only surfaces in proximity to strong light sources or illusion spells

Immune to direct fire damage — light fuels it

Reacts unpredictably to rhythmic movement (e.g. dance, music, timed traversal puzzles)



---

Behavior:

Burrows just beneath desert surfaces, creating “liquid light wakes” — shimmering trails that ripple like reflections

Lures players toward false oasis markers before striking from below

Only fully vulnerable when surfaced, typically during high heat or if baited by illusion spells

Shatters sand terrain briefly upon emerging, altering traversal



---

Known Weaknesses:

Can be lured by rhythmic gliding, illusion patterns, or mirror-based artifacts (e.g. Thulian Mirror)

Temporarily vulnerable when emerging into true shadow — especially during solar eclipses or dusk phase events

Cannot cross pure darkness or zones entirely devoid of light-hue influence



---

Notes:
Local sun-priests claim the Wyrm is the desert’s memory of the ocean — a dream of drowning transmuted into heat. Its shimmer isn’t just light — it’s thirst, searching for a reflection it once had and lost.

> “Step gently on sunlight. Something is watching its own reflection… through your shadow.”
