Lore Entry: Margin scrap from the Isabelline Widow’s threadbook, written in bone ink> “There’s a chamber where decisions breathe. And the Watcher keeps them warm.”



> “It weaves from forgotten ‘no’s, unspoken truths, and the moments we smiled when we shouldn’t have.”



> “One pilgrim entered with pride. Came out without their name. The loom didn’t approve.”



> “The tapestry isn’t wrong. It’s just honest enough to hurt.”



> “If you face it, bring only one thing: certainty. It cannot stitch what is whole.”

Bestiary Entry

Name: Tapestry Watcher
Type: Memory-Warped Construct
Threat Level: ⚠️⚠️ High – Paralyzes via Past Decisions
First Emerged: Post-Shattering, during the First Silent Weave

Description:
A tall, hooded figure nailed to a suspended loom of tattered, glowing thread. It doesn't move — but the threads do. Each glows with a line of dialogue the player once chose, or failed to choose. Its face is shrouded… but every decision is visible behind it.

Hue Interaction:

Purple-bound illusions cause the loom to replay “alternate timelines.”

Brown-bound memory echoes let players “restitch” a prior moment for defense or offense.

Yellow or truth-based spells break through its paralyzing thread-webs.


Behavior:

Hurls threads of past dialogue as attacks — successful hits “paralyze” the player in a false memory.

If the player chose contradictory dialogue paths in the past, the Watcher becomes more aggressive.

Uses illusion-laced threads to bait the player into reliving their worst choice.


Known Weaknesses:

Confession-based interactions nullify its binding attacks (truth cuts thread).

Artifacts like the Isabelline Tapestry allow thread prediction and reflection.

Blindsided if approached without any unfulfilled dialogue threads (rare).


Notes:
Defeating the Watcher does not destroy the tapestry — only moves your place within it. Some travelers report seeing their own name stitched in fresh thread before the fight even begins.
