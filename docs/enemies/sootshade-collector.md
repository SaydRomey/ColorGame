</div>A faceless figure stitched from charred parchment and drifting ash, the Sootshade glides silently through ruins — gathering fragments of scorched memory and half-burnt truth.

Carries ash-scrolls in trailing ribbons; each contains the echo of a forgotten moment, relived by force.

Lore Entry: Notes from the Bistre Archivist, smudged but intact> “Not all things burned are lost. Some simply migrate.”



> “The Sootshade comes not to kill, but to recall. To trap you in a page you never turned — and make you read it aloud.”



> “One stepped into my archive once. It didn’t walk. It lingered. When it passed, an entire section of blackened scrolls whispered back into ink — confessions no one meant to leave behind.”



> “They do not judge. But they never forget. And memory, when weaponized, burns colder than any fire.”

Bestiary Entry

Name: Sootshade Collector
Type: Ashbound Specter / Memory Leech
Threat Level: ⚠️ Moderate to High – Emotionally destabilizing
First Emerged: Ash Year 4, after the Ember-Library Collapse

Description:
Shrouded in curling soot ribbons and bearing burned fragments of memory-script, the Sootshade Collector hunts down areas of past trauma or betrayal. It seeks to preserve what should have vanished — forcing the player to face remnants of personal or world lore they might have left behind.

Hue Interaction:

Immune to fire and Crimson-based aggression.

Amplifies lingering dialogue ghosts from Violet-aligned encounters.

Neutralized temporarily by the Bistre Lantern’s glow.


Behavior:

Casts a black fog that replays memory fragments (cutscenes or flashbacks).

May paralyze the player mid-battle by echoing key past dialogue.

Hovers near burnt notes or ash-covered artifacts, trying to "read" them.


Known Weaknesses:

Vulnerable to silence spells, especially from Verdant or Violet sources.

Disperses briefly when caught in the light of the Bistre Lantern or reflective glyphs.

Becomes unstable when the player speaks truth during a forced memory sequence.


Notes:
Sootshades leave behind “Ash-Bound Pages” — rare consumable scrolls that reveal one hidden event or decision the player has forgotten. Using one rewrites the memory log... at a cost.
