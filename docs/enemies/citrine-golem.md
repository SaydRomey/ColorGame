Lore Entry: Scrawled notes from a sand-shielded expedition journal, author unknown> "We found it half-buried beyond the Gamboge Vault — just another glimmering ridge in the sand, we thought. Until it stood."



> "It didn’t roar. Didn’t run. It simply… turned. The light caught in its chest gem, and something inside me trembled. Like I owed it something."



> "Every strike we landed was swallowed — reflected in glints, as if it watched our failures and polished them."



> "I think it waits not to fight — but to endure. It judges worth by how hard you try before quitting."

Bestiary Entry

Name: Citrine Golem
Type: Radiant Construct / Elemental Juggernaut
Threat Level: ⚠️⚠️ High – Nearly impervious under sunlight
First Emerged: Built during the early Aurelian Temple Age to guard vaults and forbidden scroll-tombs


---

Description:
Towering crystalline behemoth with arms like sculpted obelisks and a faceted citrine heart. It emits faint harmonic tones when struck, as if humming to itself. Carvings across its back depict solar rites and forgotten oaths.


---

Hue Interaction:

Absorbs Aurelian (Yellow) attacks completely, reflecting them as blinding flares

Susceptible to extreme cold (Cobalt) and vibrational spells (sonic, echo-based)

Verdant roots can crack surface if seeded in shadow



---

Behavior:

Stationary until provoked or until artifact proximity detected

Stomps ground to fracture terrain; creates radiant aftershocks that slow movement

“Gleam Pulse” releases radial lightburst upon taking damage, stunning nearby attackers

Can regenerate minor cracks if exposed to direct sunlight too long



---

Known Weaknesses:

Cobalt’s Stormglass Barrier can refract its light internally, causing harmonic overload

Best fought in shaded or eclipse-affected areas

Echo-charged percussion weapons (like Prismhammer) disrupt its inner resonance



---

Notes:
Citrine Golems were never meant to kill — only to withstand. Their presence marks places the sun itself once vowed to protect.

> “If it still stands, perhaps your purpose does not.”
