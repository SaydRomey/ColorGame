</div>Animated remnants of failed soulbinding — crude bodies stitched from ritual cloth and rust-streaked bone. These marionettes jerk with unnatural precision, their joints creaking with regret.

They obey long-dead commands. And they wait.

> “We made them to test transmutation rituals. Vessels for souls too broken to scream. They walked, moved, answered. But never lived.”



> “I buried mine beneath the Phylactery Vault, but it clawed free. It didn’t attack — it waited at my old desk.”

Bestiary Entry

Name: Caput Marionette
Type: Alchemical Undead / Ritual Construct
Threat Level: ⚠️ Moderate – Area-dependent hazard
First Emerged: During the Phylactery Rebellion, Year of the Dull Moon

Description:
Caput Marionettes are abandoned constructs — partially animated corpses intended for soul transfer tests. Left unfinished, they wander memory halls and ruined labs, seeking the rituals they were meant to complete.

Hue Interaction:

Resistant to Brown (Earthen) decay effects — they are already ruined.

Weak to Violet illusions and Crimson direct damage.

Stabilized briefly by proximity to Caput Mortuum Phylactery relics.


Behavior:

Remain inert until the player interacts with specific relics, memory statues, or spirit glyphs.

On activation, they move with jerky, unnatural rhythm.

Upon death, release a decay cloud that drains equipped memory-bound artifacts unless dispelled.


Known Weaknesses:

Can be defeated preemptively with a Soulward Sigil or truth-spoken name.

Vulnerable to illusions — confused by false commands.

Paralyzed momentarily by hearing the voice of their original summoner (can be simulated via audio glyphs).


Notes:
If purified rather than killed, a Caput Marionette may kneel before the player and whisper a forgotten alchemical recipe. Some whisper in your voice.
