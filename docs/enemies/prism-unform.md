A spectral figure that flickers between all hues, 
each fragment representing a broken alignment.  
Mimics attacks and spells from multiple Orders in unstable, glitched forms.

Becomes more erratic and powerful the more hues the player has unlocked.

> "We wore colors like crowns. Then we drowned in them. 
> One escaped the palette. One became many."

> "The Unform wasn't made. It occurred. A glitch in memory. 
> A reflection of those who wore every hue and called it balance."

> "They say it remembers your colors before you do. 
> That it chooses what you forget."

> "It flickers — not because it's weak,

## Bestiary Entry
Name:	Prism Unform  
Type:	Spectral Hue Aberration  
Threat Level:	⚠️ High – Dangerous in prolonged engagements  
First Emerged:	Nullshade Collapse

### Description: 
The Prism Unform is a constantly shifting humanoid silhouette.  
Each second, it flickers between visual states: 
violet dreamshards, golden flare echoes, crimson pulses, and green growth flickers.  

The edges of its form seem to stutter, as though reality can’t agree what it once was.

### Hue Interaction:
- Cycles through hue-based attacks in glitched order.
- May cast a Red spell followed by a corrupted Blue one.
- Attacks grow stronger as the player unlocks more Hue alignments.
- Unaffected by single-hue barriers; vulnerable to total hue nullification fields.

### Behavior:
- Pursues the player slowly until provoked, then attacks with abrupt hue surges.
- Adapts to player habits: it may repeat a spell the player recently used.
- Occasionally pauses mid-fight, as if recalling something.

### Known Weaknesses:
- Vulnerable during moments of stasis between hue transitions.
- The Nullfield Sigil (artifact) suppresses its spectrum and reveals its core.
- Silent spells or attacks without elemental tags confuse it temporarily.

### Notes:
Some say defeating it causes a flicker in the environment, 
revealing a flash of the player's first memory choice.  
Others report no drops — only a glow, like mourning.
