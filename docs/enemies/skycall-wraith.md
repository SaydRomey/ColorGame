Emits shrieking gusts that cancel gliding and distort sound-based abilities.

Each wraith floats with erratic grace — as if moved by voices only it can hear.

> “When the storm broke the tower, we thought the cries were just wind in the bells.”



> But it was the wind forgetting its name. Forgetting how to be silent.



> The Wraiths came after. Not ghosts — echoes of voices torn from those who leapt or were lost among the gusts.



> One called my name. Not how I say it… how I meant it, once.



> I froze. I fell.



> We ring the bells now not for warning… but to remind the sky of silence.

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Skycall Wraith

Type:	Aerial Apparition / Wind-echo Specter
Threat Level:	⚠️ Moderate – Highly Disruptive to Traversal
First Emerged:	After the Collapse of the Singing Gate (Shattering Era)


Description:

The Skycall Wraith is a spirit-shaped echo — the wind given form by grief and repetition.
Often found patrolling high ledges or spiral currents, they disrupt movement with piercing shrieks that unbind gliding abilities and destabilize storm-anchored platforms.

They are not hostile in the traditional sense. But they call out — and what they call hurts.

Hue Interaction:

Dampens all Cobalt-based traversal effects nearby (e.g., Static Dash glide extensions).

Cries override sound-triggered puzzle inputs.

Vulnerable to grounded or Earth-based counterweights, which temporarily still their flight.


Behavior:

Patrol wind tunnels, cliff ledges, or broken sky bridges.

When provoked, emits a Disruption Cry that:

Cancels flight/glide

Disorients sound-based UI cues

At high stacks, triggers a “Vertigo Pulse” (pulls player down or sideways mid-air)


Will flee into fog if surrounded by silence (e.g., Cerulean Cloak active).


Known Weaknesses:

Weak to Earthen grounding spells, sound-null zones, or double-jump rhythm breaks.

Silence interrupts their shriek cycle.

Mind Echo can “overwrite” their cry with a stored sound (especially a player’s own voice).


Notes:

Some wraiths seem drawn to names — especially those carved or whispered.

Rumors tell of a Skycall Wraith that hums a lullaby from before the Shattering… but always off-key.
