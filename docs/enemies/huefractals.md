> “They were once part of something sacred. The Core sang with their chorus. But when the Prism cracked, the notes scattered and forgot the tune.”

“Some tried to collect them. None returned whole. Not dead — just… chromatically incorrect.”

“One danced near me once. It laughed in teal. Then wept in a color I didn’t have a word for.”

“They want to return. But they don’t remember where they began. So they collide with anything that might have been their origin.”

📘 Bestiary Entry

Name: Huefractals
Type: Prismatic Fragment / Living Hue Relic
Threat Level: ⚠️ Variable — Safe when still, catastrophic when agitated
First Emerged: Post-Core Collapse – Nullshade Genesis


---

Description:

Small, floating crystal shards, each glowing with unstable prismatic flickers. They rotate in recursive motion patterns and emit soft harmonic tones, sometimes syncing with the player’s hue state.

In groups, they create harmonic interference that destabilizes the environment — breaking light physics and bending geometry.


---

Hue Interaction:

React violently to concentrated hue magic — especially if multiple hues are active.

Each fragment carries an unstable “echo” of a specific hue. When struck, may cast random low-tier spell effects of that hue (e.g., Red = fire burst, Yellow = flash pulse).

When three or more collide, they may cause a Hue Cascade — a zone-wide chromatic distortion field that temporarily disables all hue-bound abilities.



---

Behavior:

Not aggressive unless provoked by hue alignment, spells, or AoE proximity.

In some cases, may follow the player briefly, attempting to “resonate” — which can overload equipment or inflict hue blur.

In rare Nullshade time loops, Huefractals may briefly align and “sing” a lost color, triggering a puzzle glyph sequence.



---

Known Weaknesses:

Stabilized by complete silence — no music, no abilities, no movement.

Can be grounded by Prism Glyph Anchors or Nullpulse fields (created via Nullshade puzzle completion).

Destroyed Huefractals sometimes drop Fractal Residue — used to craft unstable hue grenades or Prism Shard keys.



---

Notes:

Some Archivists claim Huefractals are what remains of the Seventh Hue.

If one resonates with the player long enough without combat, a hidden memory scene may trigger — showing the moment the Prism broke, from a non-human perspective.
