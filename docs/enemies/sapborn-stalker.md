Ambushes prey by erupting silently from tangled roots and vines.

When stationary, its bark-like skin camouflages seamlessly with the surrounding foliage.

> "The forest shifts, never sleeps, and knows more than we give it credit for. I learned this firsthand during the amber moons, when sap runs thickest. We thought ourselves alone at camp—three wardens, seasoned and vigilant. But roots moved like serpents beneath our boots.



> I first saw it when it took Elren. A shape rose from the ground as liquid amber, whisper-quiet. Elren had no time to scream; the sap hardened around his limbs, sealing his fate before our torches even flared.



> Some say these stalkers are merely plants, animated by stray magic. But I know better. Their eyes glint with cunning, and they never strike twice from the same root. They listen. They wait. If you hear sap drip slow, you're already being hunted.



> Fire keeps them at bay, but memory fades quicker than flames. And roots... roots never forget."



> — Feldgrau Veteran, recorded during the Season of Amber Silence



</details>Bestiary Entry

Name:	Sapborn Stalker

Type:	Plant Construct / Ambusher
Threat Level:	⚠️ High – Stealthy and lethal in ambush
First Emerged:	Early Post-Shattering Era


Description:

Formed from magically-infused sap and dense roots, Sapborn Stalkers are silent hunters of the Huevale forests. They take humanoid forms to mimic prey, yet beneath their barkskin lie sap-veins pulsing with quiet intent. Their eyes are dark hollows seeping faint amber trails, ever-watchful and patient.

Hue Interaction:

Resistant to Verdant-based control effects.

Sap attacks can temporarily immobilize player movement.

Leaves behind trails that slow and distort movement speed.


Behavior:

Ambushes prey by silently emerging from roots and undergrowth.

Prefers isolated or unsuspecting targets.

Will retreat if initial ambush fails, resurfacing later when prey is vulnerable again.


Known Weaknesses:

Highly vulnerable to Crimson flame attacks.

Severing or heavy slashing weapons effectively disrupt their sap-structure.

Sap can be cleansed or hardened rapidly by applying elemental extremes (fire or intense cold).


Notes:

Wardens report hearing faint whispers near Sapborn sightings, as if the forest itself aids in their hunt. Survivors speak of dreams filled with tangled roots and amber-bound visions—memories not entirely their own.
