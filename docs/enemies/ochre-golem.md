</div>Constructed from ochre-streaked limestone and fossilized memory ore, the Ochre Golem slumbers among ruins, unmoving for decades — until a trespasser disturbs what it was left to guard.
It does not rush. But it does not stop.

Lore Entry: From “Steles and Stillness,” by the Burnt Sienna Sculptor> “A statue is only still when it is being watched. Leave, and it breathes.”



> “We carved them to remember — not to defend. But the weight of memory is heavier than armor.”



> “One still stands in Mortuum’s orchard, beneath the ash-fruit tree. I etched my first sin in its chest. It has never forgiven me. That’s how I know it still works.”

Bestiary Entry

Name: Ochre Golem
Type: Animated Stone Construct / Memory Guardian
Threat Level: ⚠️ Moderate–Severe (Environmentally triggered)
First Emerged: Age of Bloom and Rust – Deployed as tomb sentries

Description:
The Ochre Golem is a memory-bound sentinel — carved by hand and imbued with ancestral resonance. Its core is a Burnt Sienna Golem Core, pulsing only when nearby relics are disturbed. Despite its sluggishness, its strikes crumble stone and stun with historical weight.

Hue Interaction:

Absorbs Brown (Earthen) healing magic as stamina.

Immobilized temporarily with Violet illusion patterns resembling its creator.

Cobalt echo-magic resonates with its memory core, forcing hesitation.


Behavior:

Remains inert until player breaks, moves, or scans an object marked with memory glyphs.

Once triggered, will not stop pursuing the intruder unless pacified or reset.

Avoids stepping on certain burial glyphs unless provoked to frenzy.


Known Weaknesses:

Temporarily pacified if a correct Memory Token (tied to its origin) is placed at its feet.

Vulnerable from behind during its “memory surge” animation — a slow, glowing pause.

Cannot cross sanctified lines created with Bistre Lantern flame.


Notes:
Some golems whisper unfinished phrases while they move — stuttering old oaths or forgotten names. If their chest etching is wiped clean, they weep stone dust… and cease.
