<details><summary>See Chartreuse Husk Lore Entry</summary>Lore Entry: From "Journal of Spoiled Vessels," by Malachite Oracle of Tinctara

> "Alchemy teaches patience; let a potion age carefully, and you find power. But leave it too long—neglect its whispers—and you get something worse than poison. I saw this tragedy unfold in the heart of our order, among monks who drank deeply of spoiled brews, mistaking decay for wisdom."



> "They laughed first—uncontrollable laughter echoing through cloisters until their faces strained and their eyes dimmed with an eerie chartreuse glow. Then came the swelling, skin stretching like ripe fruit about to burst. They wandered corridors in confusion, their laughter turning sour, acid mist dripping from their lips as joy curdled to madness."



> "These Chartreuse Husks roam Huevale now, abandoned by reason, their laughter an endless, acidic mockery. If you hear them, hold your breath and run—because laughter has never been this deadly."



> — Malachite Oracle, records sealed within Tinctara Archives

Name:	Chartreuse Husk

Type:	Corrupted Human / Alchemical Abomination
Threat Level:	⚠️ High – Dangerous Area-Denial and Toxic Attacks
First Emerged:	Late Post-Shattering Era


Description:

Chartreuse Husks were once monks of the Carthusian order, devoted to crafting potions that invigorated body and spirit. Corrupted by spoiled alchemical brews, their bodies are now bloated and semi-translucent, filled with bubbling, unstable mixtures. They continuously emit acidic vapor that corrodes both body and sanity.

Hue Interaction:

Acidic mist disrupts and corrodes hue-based abilities temporarily, causing color disorientation.

Explosion upon death releases unstable alchemical pools that linger as hazardous terrain.

Resistant to poison and most alchemical manipulations; vulnerable to purifying effects.


Behavior:

Moves slowly but persistently, emitting acidic laughter and toxic mists.

Seeks to corner prey, trapping them within clouds of confusion.

Often found wandering near abandoned shrines or ancient brewing chambers.


Known Weaknesses:

Highly vulnerable to purifying and cleansing spells (Yellow, Violet, or White hues).

Direct flame attacks (Crimson fire) ignite their volatile internal mixtures, causing them to explode prematurely.

Slow movement makes them easy to evade or target from a distance.


Notes:

Local survivors speak of chilling echoes of laughter drifting through misty groves long after encounters. Some report a lingering confusion and a bitter taste in their mouths, as though their own laughter has turned sour from mere proximity to these tragic figures.
