Its call echoes with delayed sadness ‚Äî a sob from a moment you haven't lived yet.

Often perches silently before luring prey with a name-whispering cry.

> They say the wind in Iriseld carries more than rain.
It carries loss ‚Äî wrapped in wings.



> I saw it at the cliff‚Äôs edge. It looked back. Not like a bird. Like a widow remembering.



> It called my name‚Ä¶ but my voice answered first. I felt myself move before deciding to.



> It didn‚Äôt want to kill me. It wanted me to jump. To fly.



> I clutched my cloak, not from wind ‚Äî from ache.



> ‚Äî Last line, blurred by water:
‚ÄúIts cry is your grief, wearing feathers.‚Äù

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Sorrowwing

Type:	Spirit Avian / Emotional Manipulator
Threat Level:	‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate ‚Äì Environmental Hazard, Lure-Based
First Emerged:	After the Collapse of the Windward Sanctum


Description:

A pale-winged, semi-phantasmal avian that sings with voices pulled from nearby minds.
The Sorrowwing does not strike directly ‚Äî it influences behavior through grief-colored suggestion.
Players report feeling emotional heaviness and directional compulsion after hearing its call.

Its eyes are unmistakable: glassy, human, always damp with memory.

Hue Interaction:

Specifically drawn to Cobalt-bound players with high Memory Echo charge.

Its call interferes with flight-based traversal, slightly pulling or redirecting mid-glide.

Cobalt‚Äôs Mind Echo can block or distort its influence with correct timing.


Behavior:

Prefers perching silently, remaining passive until a player attempts flight or high-speed movement.

When active:

Cries out a phrase or name from the player‚Äôs past (based on collected Memory Fragments).

Activates Lure Drift: gradually pulls player toward cliff edges or sky traps.

Sometimes circles just out of reach, causing ranged attacks to pass through.



Known Weaknesses:

Repelled or disoriented by Cerulean Cloak.

Anchoring spells (e.g., Verdant‚Äôs Skygrowth Seed) break its lure grip temporarily.

Easily grounded with memory-reinforcement artifacts like the Zaffre Vial or Celadon Shards.


Notes:

The Seers of Zaffran Port once raised Sorrowwings to guide mourners across the cliffs.
Now, only the wind walks beside the grieving.
