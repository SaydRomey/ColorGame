Lore Entry

<details><summary>See Nullshade Echo Lore Entry</summary>Lore Entry: Entry recorded by the Caput Mortuum Ascetic in “Reverberations of Unselfing”

> "I watched one retrace my sister’s footsteps — even though she died in the war of hues. The Echo did not bleed. It did not speak. It simply… reminded."



> "It mimicked her hesitation, her step backward, the way her hands shook when she refused to strike. I had forgotten that about her. And yet, the Echo hadn’t."



> "Some say they are mirror fragments of the Prismwalker. Others believe they are the world's last attempt to remind us what we once swore never to do again."



> "Whatever they are, they cannot be bested. They can only be forgiven."

Bestiary Entry

Name: Nullshade Echo
Type: Mirror Construct / Memory Apparition
Threat Level: ⚠️ Unique — Mechanically Unconventional
First Emerged: Unknown — only seen in Nullshade’s Wound

Description:

Nullshade Echo appears as a translucent silhouette of the player, or at times, a past version of them. It moves a second after the player moves, mimicking attacks, spells, or decisions already taken — sometimes even copying full combat stances or dialogue trees.

It doesn’t initiate combat. Instead, it responds — and reflects. Striking it may result in your own health dropping, a past NPC line replaying, or reversing a recent action. Sometimes, it undoes your progress if it recognizes guilt or contradiction.


---

Hue Interaction:

Immune to all hue-based attacks — any color used is reflected with inverted effect.

Vulnerable only to inaction, truth, or nonviolent choices.

Use of the Bistre Lantern reveals its source echo (what memory it’s drawn from).



---

Behavior:

Appears at critical memory junctions or lore-rich areas.

Mimics player behavior with a one-second delay, including pausing, dodging, or emoting.

Occasionally, it will "speak" — using past lines the player said in other regions.



---

Known Weaknesses:

Standing perfectly still causes it to vanish after 12 seconds.

Reciting or triggering remembered truths (via collected lore) calms it.

Touching a Shatterglass Pool while near it causes mutual reflection — both vanish.



---

Notes:

Multiple Nullshade Echoes can appear in NG+ modes — each based on a different past choice.

Some can be interacted with through dialogue. One was seen whispering a phrase the player had never spoken aloud.

If defeated properly, it fades whispering:

> “It wasn’t wrong. It was just… before.”
