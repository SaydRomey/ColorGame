Lore Entry: From “Catacombs of Auralith,” Scribed by Bistre Archivist> “The dead do not always lie still in Auralith. Some walk — not out of spite, but because their name hasn’t been laid to rest.”



> “The Wickbone Lanterns were once torchbearers of the Phylactery Vault. Now they bear witness instead — to false pilgrims, broken promises, and memories sealed too tightly.”



> “To follow one is to risk being led into truths you hoped would stay buried. Their flame does not burn, but it reveals. That, some say, is worse.”

Bestiary Entry

Name: Wickbone Lantern
Type: Undead Construct / Memory Beacon
Threat Level: ⚠️ Moderate (Passive until provoked or followed)
First Emerged: Post-Shattering — Collapse of the Phylactery Vault

Description:
The Wickbone Lantern resembles a slow-moving humanoid skeleton with a cracked skull and hollow eye sockets. Inside its ribcage flickers a soulflame — pale orange tinged with grey, casting elongated, erratic shadows.

It wanders aimlessly through forgotten halls and sunken crypts, illuminating glyphs and murals that react only to its light.

Hue Interaction:

Flame reacts strongly to Violet-bound illusions, warping nearby terrain into false memories.

Yellow-bound players can “follow” its path safely for longer without triggering traps.

Earthen spells may dim or brighten its flame — useful for revealing hidden lore.


Behavior:

Non-aggressive unless directly attacked or followed into a soultrap zone.

When followed, it may lead to sealed memory puzzles, past-decision rooms, or ghost ambushes.

If its flame is extinguished without care, it screams — summoning 1–3 Memory Husks.


Known Weaknesses:

The Bistre Lantern’s light can stabilize its flame, revealing its “last burial site” — allowing peaceful dispelling.

Alchemical cold or illusions of stillness (e.g. Glamour Pulse) may cause it to halt long enough to pass.

Can be bound temporarily using a Caput Mortuum Phylactery for puzzle or environmental traversal.


Notes:
Players who ignore the Lantern’s path often miss hidden vaults and Memory Echo entries. However, following too closely without the correct hue-balance may cause “reflection bleed” — a debuff where the player’s reflection attacks them in later scenes.
