Hides in low light, strikes from bloom-covered surfaces.

Its body coils in spirals — like sunlight trying to become memory.

> “The lilies grieve when it feeds. They know it was once part of them.”



> The Heliotropic Lurker was not planted. It grew from sorrow, a vine that refused to wither when the sun set on its garden.



> It stalks by scent, by shadow-angle, by memory of warmth. It never hunts in full light, but flares when dawn rises — a final hunger before retreat.



> Some say it only appears to those carrying heliotrope — the band, the bloom, or the guilt. Others believe it is drawn to unresolved farewells.



> If it sees you, it won’t chase.



> It will wait.



> — Liseran Caretaker, beneath the Weeping Lilies

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Heliotropic Lurker

Type:	Lurking Flora / Light-Stalker
Threat Level:	⚠️ High – Ambush Predator in Twilight
First Emerged:	After the Withering Bloom, under Liseran Shrine


Description:

A vine-creature that moves only when light shifts. It uses heliotrope blossoms as sensors, blooming toward sources of hue. Its strikes are sudden — from petal to fang in less than a heartbeat.

It is silent, but players report feeling “watched” before it strikes.

Hue Interaction:

Amplified by light-based spells — glows stronger when struck with Radiant Echo.

Weakened by darkness or shadow-binding abilities.

If the player wears the Heliotrope Band, it becomes aware but hesitant — waiting for your guard to drop.


Behavior:

Burrows under bloom-pools and vine walls; bursts up when the player lingers or casts healing spells.

Latches with thorned tendrils that drain hue slowly over time.

Retreats during full light or after being seen through a Thulian Mirror.


Known Weaknesses:

Vulnerable to sudden darkness — illusions or shadow bursts cause it to recoil.

Can be distracted by moving light sources (e.g. fireflies, glowing illusions).

If caught mid-bloom, its petals become brittle — a precise strike then can destroy its nerve-center.


Notes:

Some believe the Lurker can remember those it failed to catch, and will follow them across regions, reappearing near heliotrope growths.
Defeating it may yield a Withered Bloom-Core, usable in memory-bound rituals or light-sensitive traps.
