</div>Born from the Prism Wound itself, this unstable construct limps through space as if limping through time. Pieces of it glow and vanish — as if they forget to exist. It doesn’t seek you out… it seeks coherence.

> "It emerged the moment the Core shattered. A figure, not whole — walking without footsteps. Light poured from its ribs, but it was cold."



> "It didn’t speak. But I heard it. Not sound — absence. Every time I tried to write, the ink vanished."



> "My companion reached out. His hand glowed. Then it was gone. Then he was."



> "The Wound Remnant is not a being. It is an afterimage of agony too large to stay still. You don’t kill it. You just outlast the part of yourself it remembers."

Bestiary Entry

Name: Wound Remnant
Type: Coreborn Echo / Memory Entity
Threat Level: ⚠️ High (Environmental Distortion)
First Emerged: At the Prism Shattering


---

Description:

A humanoid construct of light-fissured crystal, limping unnaturally, its joints misaligned. It emits ghost-white flashes as it moves, temporarily distorting the environment — UI stutters, visual frames glitch, terrain deconstructs briefly.

Its core pulses with a delayed heartbeat — if it syncs with yours, a fragment of your HUD is lost until reset.


---

Hue Interaction:

Damaging it with any hue magic causes it to resonate in that color briefly — after which it mirrors that hue’s weakness.

Most susceptible to Brown and Purple — memory and paradox destabilize its frame.



---

Behavior:

Slowly patrols the Prism Wound region.

Attacks by stepping into proximity — causing echo pulses that stagger and blind.

Periodically emits a “light bleed” — briefly fades the screen to white and removes HUD elements.



---

Known Weaknesses:

Memory artifacts like the Bistre Lantern anchor its location, preventing phasing.

Violet’s Illusion Clone causes it to mimic a false version of you and momentarily collapse.

Crimson damage (if timed correctly) during its “pulse sync” can fracture its memory spine.



---

Notes:

Sometimes whispers past player dialogue lines during whiteout pulses — lines you may have said earlier in the game.

After defeat, leaves behind a “Cracked Memory Core” — required to access the deepest level of the Prism Wound.
