</div>Sun-scorched and half-maddened, these jackals stalk Luxeran‚Äôs dunes by heat and scent, their eyes blistered shut by generations under relentless light.

They mistake warmth for weakness ‚Äî drawn not by sight, but by the breath of firelight or radiant magic.  
Their howl echoes dry and broken, scattering across the dunes like splintered glass.

Often found circling dying torches or sun-baked ruins, 
they fear cold and recoil from shade, becoming sluggish after dusk.

Lore Entry: Fragment from ‚ÄúScorch and Silence,‚Äù a journal recovered near the Gamboge Vault> "I watched it circle the mirage fire for hours, never knowing it wasn‚Äôt real. It yipped and snapped at flickering sand. Not blind ‚Äî not quite ‚Äî but worse: its mind burns with too much sun and too little shadow."

> "They don‚Äôt see. They feel heat like scent ‚Äî like music. My torch nearly killed me. I had to drop it and run silent into the dunes."

> "They say these beasts were once clever pack hunters, adapted to the shifting deserts. But now‚Ä¶ now they worship warmth like it‚Äôs a god that betrayed them."

> "At night, I found one curled into a broken clay brazier, whimpering at the cold stars."

> ‚ÄîExcerpt attributed to a Fulvous Hunter, name unknown

## Bestiary Entry

Name: Sunburnt Jackal  
Type: Desiccated Predator / Heat-Hound  
Threat Level: ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate ‚Äì Lethal in packs or near radiant spells  
First Emerged: Late Color War ‚Äì After the Dawn Siege of Luxeran

---

Description:  
The Sunburnt Jackal is a lean, copper-hued beast with mangy fur and blistered skin.  
Its eyes are milky and mostly blind, but its nose and heat-sense have become grotesquely overdeveloped.

Fiercely territorial, it is drawn to any radiant source ‚Äî spells, relics, or campfires.  
Its bite sears from residual heat; its howl distorts into warped echoes that disrupt auditory clarity.

---

Hue Interaction:
- Drawn to Aurelian (Yellow) magic or any active light source
- Avoids deep shadow or cold environments
- Can be stunned by Cobalt (Blue) flashburst spells or illusions that mask heat

---

Behavior:
- Hunts by triangulating body heat and radiant echoes
- Will chase thrown torches or glowing relics as a distraction
- Packs coordinate using howls that ricochet strangely in heat haze
- Cowers from dusk or cloudy conditions; most active midday

---

Known Weaknesses:
- Ice and shadow spells dampen senses
- Easily misled by artificial light or false heat signatures
- Loud noises (explosives, sonic artifacts) disorient pack coordination

---

Notes:  
Desert guides often carry heat-absorbent stones or cold-blood salves to mask their presence.  
It's said that if a Sunburnt Jackal is howling at an empty flame, it‚Äôs mourning a prey that never burned.

### üü° Sunburnt Jackal
> ‚ÄúIt never learned the difference between shadow and prey.‚Äù

Type: Desert Predator  
Region: Luxeran ‚Äì The Gilded Expanse  
Hue Affinity: Aurelian (Yellow) ‚Äî Inverted  
Tactics: Heat-Seeker, Lunge Hunter  
Weakness: Shade, Cold, Nightfall  

Description:  
Once noble scavengers of the high desert, 
Sunburnt Jackals have become blister-eyed heat-hounds, 
their sight eroded by centuries under Luxeran‚Äôs merciless sun.  
Their fur is patchy and baked copper-red, with long skeletal limbs and a mouth filled with cracked teeth, 
always panting ‚Äî not from exhaustion, but anticipation.  
They no longer see as mortals do. They smell light.

They stalk by scenting radiant magic and body heat, mistaking warmth for weakness. Their howl warbles in a heat-distorted echo, used to triangulate prey across dunes. They lunge from sandpools, tongues lolling, pupils pin-prick thin.

At night, they become sluggish and fearful ‚Äî huddled in pits, twitching toward dreams of firelight.

---

Combat Behavior:  
Aggro range expands if player uses Radiant spells or torches.  
Occasionally circles a mirage flame ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs fake.  
Packs coordinate howls to cause disorientation (screen shimmer & blur).  
Lunges toward light sources (player-placed or natural).

Counterplay:  
Cold spells or shadow-casting terrain slow movement and stun momentarily.  
Shadeborne or dusk environments reduce aggro.  
Dropping torches or Radiant Flares can mislead them temporarily.

Lore Fragment ‚Äì Memory Echo (if defeated near Gamboge Monk):  
> ‚ÄúIt chased the sun until its shadow disappeared. And then it ate the silence.‚Äù
