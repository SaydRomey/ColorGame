  <h3>Silence Incarnate</h3>
  <i>It watches. It judges. It never blinks.</i><br>

<!-- "Some truths need no voice. Only a gaze." -->

A floating, faceless figure robed in layered black and voidlight.  
Its eyes — or what pass for them — never shift, never close.  
When you move, it does not. But when you stop… it remembers everything.

<!--
An unmoving, cloaked sentinel suspended midair, 
Silence Incarnate is not an attacker — it is an observer.  
Its power comes from stillness, its weapon from what it denies.  
As long as it sees you, you cannot act.

## Lore Entry

<details><summary>See Silence Incarnate Lore Entry</summary>

### Lore Entry: Found etched behind a hidden prism in the Monolith Library of Nullshade.

> "I once bowed before it. It did nothing. I ran. Still nothing. 
> But when I stood still… it saw me."

> "No weapon can harm it. No hue impresses it. 
> It doesn’t punish — it measures."

> "The old ones called it 'Judgment Uninvited'. 
> A test you don’t know you’re failing."

> "Only by breaking its sight can you move freely. 
> But know this — when it blinks, it remembers your shape."

<!--
### Lore Entry: “Notes on Spectral Stagnation” — Scratched into obsidian by a forgotten archivist.

> "It hovered where thought slowed. 
> Where voices curled back into minds."

> "It didn’t chase. It didn’t strike. 
> It simply watched — and I forgot how to move."

> "The others tried to shout past it. 
> Their words crumbled before leaving their lips."

> "I hid behind a broken arch. Then I blinked. It was behind me."

### Description:
A hovering enemy cloaked in stillness.  
It doesn't attack — it imposes presence.  
Its gaze disables all movement abilities, casting, and UI feedback when sustained.  
You cannot confront it directly — only escape its gaze.

<!--
### Description:
A floating shrouded figure with no visible face.  
Its “eye” is a subtle shimmer in the hood’s center — not always open, not always there.  
When it gazes at the player, action becomes impossible: casting, dodging, speaking all fail.
-->

---

### Hue Interaction:
- Nullifies all active hue-based abilities when visible.
- Can only be misdirected using illusion spells, light-bending terrain, or architectural interference.

<!--
### Hue Interaction:
- Blocks active hue abilities while maintaining line of sight.
- Vulnerable to indirect effects — illusions, reflection-based mechanics, or mirrored light paths.
-->

---

### Behavior:
- Appears near key glyph gates or during silent puzzle segments.
- Does not pursue, but rotates slowly to follow your last clear movement.
- If it locks eyes for more than 3 seconds, disables your action inputs until you find cover or line-break.

<!--
### Behavior:
- Does not move, but repositions when unobserved — instantaneously.
- Anchors itself to echo-nodes in the arena, becoming briefly immune while settled.
- Can turn slowly to adjust gaze; dodging behind architecture temporarily nullifies its field.
-->

---

### Known Weaknesses:
- Reflections (like Shatterglass Pools) confuse its targeting briefly.
- Using Violet’s Glamour Pulse or Yellow’s Lightform Cloak can disrupt its line of sight.
- Activating certain lore-bound artifacts (e.g., the Bistre Lantern or Isabelline Tapestry) may cause it to recede or glitch.

<!--
### Known Weaknesses:
- Breaking line of sight with terrain or mirrored prism shards allows action again.
- Defeated by using the “Reverse Gaze” effect from the Prismwalker’s relic arsenal.
- Whisper-based spells (from Violet or Brown hue sets) disrupt its fixation.
-->

---

### Notes:
Presence fades after completing key puzzle objectives.  
If ignored too long, the area around it distorts — time slows, UI shimmers, sound vanishes.  
Some players report feeling watched after defeating it.

<!--
### Notes:
- Players have reported UI flickers or text stuttering when under its gaze.
- Some lore suggests it was once a Prismara priest who silenced herself in protest — and was forgotten by color itself.
