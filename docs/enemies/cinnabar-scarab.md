  <i>"It shines when afraid. Which is always."</i><br><br>
</div>A desert jewel that lives to mislead. The Cinnabar Scarab is as radiant as it is restless — not by nature, but by fear. When threatened, it does what all bright things in Luxeran do: it multiplies... or pretends to.

Lore Entry: Recovered notes from “Scarab Whispers” by Fulvous Hunter Orei> "You don’t find a scarab nest. You walk into one — thinking it’s treasure, or shade, or salvation."



> "I cracked one with my heel once. It screamed. I did too. Because then there were ten. Then twenty. All of them fake. All of them not quite wrong."



> "Only the real one bleeds dust. The rest... flicker. They don’t stop moving unless you sing."



> "I don’t hunt them anymore. I just let them follow me. And hope the fake ones scare off worse things."

Bestiary Entry

Name: Cinnabar Scarab
Type: Illusory Swarm / Reflexive Mimic
Threat Level: ⚠️ Caution Advised – Confusion and swarm risk
First Emerged: Post-Shattering, beneath the Citrine Tombs


---

Description:
Small beetles with crimson-glass carapaces that shimmer in sunlight. The scarab emits light distortions when startled, spawning illusory copies of itself. The real one is indistinguishable at a glance, and disappears into its fakes if not dealt with swiftly.


---

Hue Interaction:

Reacts erratically to Aurelian light pulses

Susceptible to Cobalt-based tracking spells (Mind Echo reveals the original’s thought pattern)

Confused by Verdant growth spells that disrupt its mirrored movement path



---

Behavior:

Travels in loose clusters; nests near ruins, shade-stones, and citrus groves

Upon threat, splits into visual duplicates with randomized patterns

The true scarab emits a faint heat signature — or responds to music

Duplicates fade if player stands completely still for several seconds



---

Known Weaknesses:

Easily scattered by sound-based effects (drums, chants, Razzmatazz Drum)

Disrupted by illusion counters, especially from Violet-bound illusions

Vulnerable to heat-sensing relics or wide-range pulse attacks



---

Notes:
To Luxeran jewelhunters, a single real scarab is worth a satchel of gold — if they can catch it. But many vanish chasing light that turns to laughter.

> “In Luxeran, even fear learns to sparkle.”
