Lore Entry: From “The Clocks That Bled,” Eburnean desert chronicle etched into goldleaf bark> "Before there were calendars, there were these things — time given feet and fury."



> "The Scarwalkers don’t speak. They don’t dream. They mark. Each movement carves a moment. Each kill, a tick lost."



> "You only notice its approach by your heartbeat syncing to the drag of its shadow."



> "The sun loves its children orderly. The Scarwalker ensures it."

Bestiary Entry

Name: Sundial Scarwalker
Type: Construct / Solar Chronoknight
Threat Level: ⚠️ High – Time-reactive combatant
First Emerged: Built pre-Shattering as timekeepers and guardians of sacred solar rituals; corrupted by the Huefall


---

Description:
Towering warrior built from layered sun-tempered stone and obsidian. Its “face” is a circular sundial ring that rotates subtly. It leaves scorch-marks shaped like clock hands where it steps.


---

Hue Interaction:

Ignores illusionary magic completely — always acts on “true” player movement

Highly reactive to Aurelian light mechanics: speeds up when in bright light, slows in shadow

Temporally disrupted by Cobalt echo abilities or time-fracture artifacts



---

Behavior:

"Hourstep" mechanic: only moves when the player does — mimicking your last path with a 2-second delay

"Noonstrike" ability: at high sun (in bright zones), attacks deal double damage if player is mid-action

"Shadowbind" counter: when its own shadow aligns with the player’s, it stuns and delivers a critical slash

Emits rhythmic drumming as it nears; players who ignore its shadow’s movement are often ambushed



---

Known Weaknesses:

Predictable with clever timing — pausing or stutter-stepping confuses its delayed tracking

Most vulnerable when casting its own sundial glyphs (slow animation wind-up)

Blocking light or using sun-disruption tools disables its Noonstrike temporarily



---

Notes:
Many travelers mistakenly believe Scarwalkers are blind — they’re not. They simply don’t need eyes. Their “vision” is your rhythm, your weight, your urgency. Walk without purpose… and you live. For a little longer.
