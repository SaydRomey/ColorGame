“Every step is applause from the storm.”

The strings glow. The audience vanishes. The silence remains.

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Tempest Marionette

Type:	Skybound Construct / Elemental Dancer
Threat Level:	⚠️ High – Agile, Reflective, Grace-Locked
First Emerged:	After the Skyglass Amphitheater's collapse


Description:

A once-ceremonial construct created for aerial rituals and performances, the Tempest Marionette was left unfinished when the sky fell silent.
Now reanimated by the Iriseld storm network, it moves not with malice but with unending choreography.

Each motion is precise, beautiful — and deadly.

Hue Interaction:

Reflects low-grade projectile spells (especially Cobalt bolts) with a pirouette spin.

When Crimson is nearby, the Marionette’s tempo increases — mimicking combat rhythms.

Weak to disruptive beats or tempo-breaking pulses (e.g. off-rhythm chimes, Mind Echo at odd intervals).


Behavior:

Patrols abandoned amphitheaters, wind shrines, or sky-ritual rings.

In battle:

Uses Arcstep Waltz: rapid circular dashes with after-image delay.

Activates Glass Pointe to parry midair attacks.

Charges a finisher: Curtain Fall — triggers a downward lightning spear and midair shock pulse.



Known Weaknesses:

Overloadable with high-intensity storm surge spells (from certain weather events or relics).

Disrupted by the Glaucous Feather’s silence aura.

Temporarily stunned if her dance is rhythmically broken (by clashing tempo illusions or uneven terrain shifts).


Notes:

Some say she still performs for an audience only she can see — perhaps trapped echoes in the skyglass.

Others believe she was designed not to entertain, but to mourn.
