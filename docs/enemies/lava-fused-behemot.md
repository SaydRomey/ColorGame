> “We did not create it. We unburied it.”



> "They say the Lava-Fused was born from beneath — a beast the size of a siege tower, resting in magma until rage woke it. Not a dragon, not a titan — just the shape fire chose to wear."



> "Its back vents fury. Its breath melts spears. The earth bends around it. Nothing in Vireya moves so slowly — or kills so fast."



> "Some Ember Priests believe it carries a buried heart — the first fire, unquenched and still dreaming of destruction. Others say it has no heart. That’s why it burns so loud."

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Lava-Fused Behemoth

Type:	Elemental Beast / Obsidian Juggernaut
Threat Level:	⚠️ Extreme – Environmental Hazard & Area Denial
First Emerged:	Deepflare Surge, Post-Prism Fracture


Description:

The Lava-Fused Behemoth is a slow-moving mountain of molten power. Its armored hide is obsidian-formed, fissured with glowing lava. It does not hunt — it erupts. Territorial, ancient, and nearly unkillable in open terrain, its presence reshapes battlefields and can block entire routes through the Ember Expanse.

Hue Interaction:

Immune to Crimson fire — actually strengthened by it (triggers lava bursts).

Reacts negatively to Cobalt chill or steam-based attacks, causing armor plates to crack.

Earthen stonebind can briefly root its limbs, though only at weak spots.


Behavior:

Patrols molten ravines or dormant calderas.

Moves slow unless provoked — then charges explosively in a straight line.

Breathes gouts of flame from spinal vents. Occasionally triggers lava floods that force repositioning.


Known Weaknesses:

Molten vent on its upper back glows when overcharged — vulnerable for a few seconds.

Temporarily immobilized by cooled terrain (player can freeze lava paths beneath it).

Dislikes sonic vibrations — resonance from seismic runes or drum spells can destabilize footing.


Notes:

Behemoths do not die easily. Those who fell one say it doesn’t scream — it sighs, as if disappointed the world still resists burning. In certain temples, its silhouette is worshipped as a god that never needed worship — only room to rage.
