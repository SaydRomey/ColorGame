> “We gave her grief. She gave us grace.”



> "The Funeral Dancer once performed only for the dead — her steps choreographed to farewell the honored fallen. But war came too fast, and death too often. She could not keep up. So she never stopped."



> "Now she dances across ash-fields and battlegrounds, pirouetting through memory and flame. No audience. No end. Just names whispered in rhythm and the clang of blades to mark the time."



> "Her sigils are not spells. They are stories. And when she finishes the story, something always dies."

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Funeral Dancer

Type:	Spectral Performer / Ritual Assassin
Threat Level:	⚠️ High – AoE Timing, Illusion & Delayed Hazards
First Emerged:	The Last Ember Gala, pre-Crimson Collapse


Description:

The Funeral Dancer is a haunting presence — cloaked in ash-grey silk, wreathed in ghostly flame. She does not hunt or charge. She simply begins to dance. Her movements draw circles in the dust, carving patterns of mourning that turn lethal when completed. She laughs as she spins. The laughter fades only when she bows.

Hue Interaction:

Cloaked in Crimson illusions while mid-dance — vulnerable only between steps.

Cobalt sound interrupts her tempo, breaking sigil formation.

Earthen grounding slows her spin, allowing safer approach.


Behavior:

Opens with a slow spiral step — each movement leaving a glowing sigil.

After four to six steps, stops to perform a “bow” — triggering the explosion of all active sigils.

If struck mid-combo, immediately shifts into evasive spin and relocates.


Known Weaknesses:

During her “final pose,” she is vulnerable for a full second — ideal time to strike.

Sigils can be absorbed by Reflection Ward or overwritten with player sigil-magic.

Interrupt spells (particularly with rhythmic or musical timing) destabilize her choreography completely.


Notes:

Some say she’s not a monster, but a memory too strong to forget — one dancer still trying to mourn a thousand souls alone. If you survive her dance, she sometimes vanishes in a swirl of ash… and you feel oddly honored, like you were briefly part of the performance.
