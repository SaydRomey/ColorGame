Her blade leaves no wound — only a fading silhouette of the strike.

Eyes shine like still water before a storm.

> Her duels never end. Not because she wins, but because the mirror never breaks.



> In life, she was a master of the Skyglass Pillars — undefeated, yet unremembered.



> When the storms shattered the arena’s ceiling, she was still mid-swing.



> Some say her opponent left. Others say he never existed.



> Now, she reflects the one who enters — matching form, speed, and flaw.



> There are no spectators anymore. Only reflections.

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Mirrorwake Duelist

Type:	Illusory Swordmaster / Storm-Arena Echo
Threat Level:	⚠️ High – Unpredictable & Reflection-Bound
First Emerged:	After the Collapse of the Skyglass Arena


Description:

A duelist bound not to memory, but to mirrored surfaces. She moves across puddles, fragments, and skyglass panels with eerie grace — her attacks calibrated to the player’s form, reflected with lethal delay.

She does not speak. Her blade interprets your posture like a question.

Hue Interaction:

Only vulnerable when reflected simultaneously in two surfaces (water/glass).

Crimson clashes disrupt her rhythm; Cobalt echoes reveal hidden stances.

Verdant’s vines distort her movement path but do not bind her.


Behavior:

Shifts position by teleporting between reflective zones.

Behavior cycle:

Mirage Lunge – charges where your reflection last moved.

Refracted Parry – blocks frontal Hue spells with mirrored delay.

Glassflame Riposte – strikes from an adjacent reflection after being dodged.



Known Weaknesses:

Mirrorwake loses coordination if the player breaks all local reflections (e.g., shattering panels or vaporizing puddles).

Combat simplified during storm-induced fog, which dulls mirrored clarity.

Temporarily stunned by Payne’s Brush illusions (overwhelms her sense of “who is real”).


Notes:

Skydancer lore claims her final opponent left behind no reflection.

Some say if you defeat her without casting a shadow, she will bow… and vanish.
