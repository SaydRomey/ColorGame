</div>The Memory Grafter is not a killer — it is an editor. Cloaked in patchwork ink and hue-scratched robes, it walks the unseen line between truth and story, harvesting identity like fruit that ripened too early.

> “It didn’t kill her. It rewrote her. When I found what was left, she still moved like my sister. Still used her name. But when she spoke, I knew…”

“She had new stories. Ones she hadn’t lived.”

“He holds a scroll. Always writing. Always replacing. You see yourself on it, eventually.”

“If you forget the color of your thoughts — you’ve already been grafted.”

📘 Bestiary Entry

Name: Memory Grafter
Type: Narrative Parasite / Nullshade Manipulator
Threat Level: ⚠️ High – Reality distortion and identity theft
First Emerged: Mid-Nullshade Collapse, during the Prism Shard Fracture


---

Description:

A tall, shrouded figure bearing a scroll of inked names and colored glyphs. Its face is an empty vellum mask that shifts depending on who sees it.

Moves fluidly, yet without sound — always one step behind or ahead. Leaves behind fading afterimages that quote memories the player never made.


---

Hue Interaction:

Immune to most hue damage — instead, hue attacks are reflected as twisted abilities (e.g., a Green healing spell becomes a Brown decay tether).

Occasionally rewrites one of your equipped abilities temporarily — switching it for a flawed version with different mechanics or cost.

Can be destabilized briefly by Violet paradox effects or Bistre Lantern activations.



---

Behavior:

Doesn’t initiate combat in the usual sense — instead, lingers near puzzle areas or lore reveals.

Begins by mimicking small parts of the player’s history: gear loadout, early dialogue, voice lines.

If not interrupted, escalates by replacing one of your passive traits or even UI labels (e.g., renaming a button from “Attack” to “Regret”).



---

Known Weaknesses:

Binding it within a Prism Sigil Circle can “pin” its scroll — revealing and undoing some of its grafts.

Interrupted if a true memory is spoken aloud via a scripted prompt (player must recall something from early game).

Weakens when confronted by another player-character’s memory shard (e.g., an NPC echo from a side quest).



---

Notes:

Memory Grafters are said to be the reason some Prismwalkers “go silent” — not because they die, but because they forget they existed.

One theory suggests they are fragments of Prismara’s subconscious — the Core trying to rewrite its own shame.
