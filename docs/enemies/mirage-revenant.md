Mirage Revenant – The Flickering Lie

  <h3>Mirage Revenant</h3>
  <i>A phantom promise in the sand</i></br>

</div>Appears as a harmless illusion — a friendly traveler, glinting treasure chest, or even a familiar face. But when approached or touched, the illusion breaks, revealing a bladed phantom wrapped in distorted light.

Often found near ruins, vaults, or mirage oases, the Mirage Revenant is a remnant of greed twisted by Luxeran’s radiant curses. It lingers near hopes too bright, feeding on belief itself.

Lore Entry: Transcript from “The Gambler’s Mirage,” an oral tale passed in Eburnea markets> "It looked like my brother. I hadn’t seen him since the siege. He waved me over — smiled with that chipped tooth he had."



> "But when I stepped close, the smile stayed too still. The eyes didn’t blink. The shadow… wasn’t his."



> "I drew my blade too late. It stabbed through my own hesitation."



> "They say the desert keeps your hopes warm so they don’t rot. But sometimes, they burn instead — and something crawls out of the ashes wearing your smile."



> — Told by a relic-hunter named Sarmin, who never smiled again

Bestiary Entry

Name: Mirage Revenant
Type: Illusory Specter / Radiant Trap
Threat Level: ⚠️ Moderate – Extremely dangerous to unaware players
First Emerged: Post-Shattering Era, especially around collapsed sunshrines


---

Description:
A Revenant cloaked in living mirage. It takes the form of what the viewer most expects to see — a helper, a relic, a shelter — and lures them in.

When the illusion collapses (usually on approach), the Revenant erupts in a burst of searing light and lashes with radiant claws. It moves unpredictably, shimmering with heatwaves.


---

Hue Interaction:

Immune to Aurelian light spells unless they’re truth-aligned

Susceptible to Cobalt’s Mind Echo (shatters the illusion)

Dispelling its glamour with illusions (Violet) or relics like the Citrine Lens reveals its true form instantly



---

Behavior:

Remains stationary while disguised — uses familiar visual bait

Once revealed, becomes fast and aggressive

Uses heat mirage to blur itself and teleport short distances

Disappears entirely if not attacked quickly after revealing



---

Known Weaknesses:

Easily unmasked with true-sight or illusion-canceling effects

Fears memory artifacts (like Zaffre Vial) that replay reality

Stumbles briefly after its illusion is broken



---

Notes:
Scholars debate whether these creatures were ever real people — lost souls burned into radiant echoes — or desert-born constructs made from longing. Some swear they whispered names only the dead would know.
