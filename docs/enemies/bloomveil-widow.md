> ‚ÄúI found her first, but she spoke in threads.‚Äù



> The Widow is not death, nor is she a predator. She is a memory woven to this place ‚Äî something we did in ages long past, when trust and fear were the same word.



> Her webs never cease weaving. They are grown from moments left unresolved. Long-forgotten dreams. Pains she once whispered to me, and I believed her.



> I‚Äôve heard it in her voice: a lullaby laced with scent and silk. That‚Äôs how she dances ‚Äî we only feel it when we breathe her in. And her last dance is always the one we never finish.



> Do not speak to her. She wears promises, but never gives them back.



> ‚Äî Wisteria Enchantress, evening twilight, in the dance of dreams

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Bloomveil Widow

Type:	Illusionary Arachnid / Dream-Weaver
Threat Level:	‚ö†Ô∏è High ‚Äî Vulnerability Through Charm and Webs
First Emerged:	Born from nightmares woven into Myrrala's blooms


Description:

The Bloomveil Widow is a spectral predator created from the collective dreams of the fey. As much a trickster as a predator, she weaves charming webs that ensnare both mind and body.

Her webs are woven from memories ‚Äî those not just forgotten, but abandoned. Once ensnared, her victims will find themselves questioning their reality.

Her charm pheromones cause those who enter her lair to grow lethargic or entranced, before she strikes.

Hue Interaction:

Immune to Cobalt's Mind Echo and Verdant's Root Pulse due to her illusionary nature.

Can be unmasked by Violet Illusion Clone or Thulian Mirror.

Light-based spells disrupt her webs temporarily, revealing her true form.


Behavior:

Initially appears as a calming presence, offering assistance or guidance through pheromones.

If the player gets too close, her charming webs trap the player in dream loops, requiring timed escapes.

Teleports short distances via web threads, dropping multiple webs as she dances.

The player must disrupt her rhythm by attacking when her webs are weak.


Known Weaknesses:

Vulnerable when her real form is exposed ‚Äî requires Thulian Mirror or Violet Bound to trigger.

Can be silenced using Cobalt's Mind Echo or Aurelian's Light Trick.

Attacks fail to charm if Heliotrope Band is equipped.


Notes:

Her webs may trap past memories in physical form, forcing the player to confront emotional barriers. Players who face her may experience a deep connection with past regrets or lost dreams. The webs leave a lingering sense of d√©j√† vu.
