🧠 Lore Entry

> “They were built, not born — shaped by Verdant hands, bound by Crimson oaths, and given Earthen patience.”

“We placed them at thresholds: shrine gates, color wells, fractured memory vaults. Each one was a sentinel of silence — no breath, no hunger, only the weight of duty.”

“But the Orders fell. The rituals ended. And still they watched.”

“I passed one once. Thought it dead. I touched the relic behind it, and its chest ignited with glyph-fire.”

“They don’t move like beasts. They move like decisions you regret — slow, deliberate, irreversible.”

“Do not speak lies near a Wickerborn. They hear tension in truth like wind through cane.”

📘 Bestiary Entry

Name: Wickerborn
Type: Construct / Huebound Guardian
Threat Level: ⚠️ Moderate–High – Dormant until provoked
First Emerged: Prismara War — Relic Age


---

Description:

Towering, humanoid constructs formed from braided plant matter, sun-dried bones, and iron lashings. Their limbs creak like branches in windless air, and when idle, they resemble statues or broken totems.

A faint, inner glow can be seen between their ribs when activated — like dying embers remembering purpose.


---

Hue Interaction:

Aligned with Verdant (Green) and Earthen (Brown), but triggered by Crimson (Red) proximity.

Ignore most damage unless purpose is disrupted (e.g. disturbing relics, lying to NPCs near them).

Strong resistance to illusion and glamour effects.



---

Behavior:

Remain inert until:

A nearby relic is touched.

A lie is spoken during dialogue nearby.

A shrine is activated without proper hue alignment.


Once triggered:

Slow pursuit begins (deliberate, methodical, and inescapable in straight lines).

Enters a berserk state if cornered — flailing vine whips and lash roots.


Will reassemble over time if not destroyed by fire or crystalline impact.



---

Known Weaknesses:

Burnable — vulnerable to Crimson fire, especially to joints and binding roots.

Shattering via Earthen shock collapses their inner structure.

"Stillbark Oils" can slow their motion if applied to relics in advance.



---

Notes:

Some Whisperers claim that Wickerborn remember names spoken in their presence — even centuries later.

The Caput Mortuum Ascetic once called them “our final promise — to watch what mattered when we no longer could.”
