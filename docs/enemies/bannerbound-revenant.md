Emits a mournful war-horn tone that summons ash-shades — spectral warriors bound to the flag’s presence.

Grows stronger the longer it marches uninterrupted.

Bestiary Entry

Name:	Bannerbound Revenant

Type:	Spectral Commander / Shade-Summoner
Threat Level:	⚠️ High – Summoner, Momentum-Based Threat
First Emerged:	Post-Ember Accord Collapse, date disputed


Description:

The Bannerbound Revenant is a ghostly war captain bound to a still-burning standard. It drags this ember-laced banner through scorched lands, its weight both burden and anchor. Wherever it marches, forgotten warriors rise to follow, compelled not by memory, but by the banner’s echoing will.

Hue Interaction:

The banner resonates with Crimson, growing in size and summoning more shades if not suppressed.

Vulnerable to Cobalt silence fields — can temporarily disable the call to arms.

Violet resonance can “recode” the banner — turning its shades against it for a short time.


Behavior:

Slowly advances toward key terrain markers (shrines, walls, gates).

Every few steps, plants the banner to raise Ash Shades (basic melee ghosts).

Upon losing enough health, it plants the banner and fuses with it — entering a second phase.


Known Weaknesses:

Banner can be stolen or severed (by completing a timed interaction or using specific Hue relics).

Suffers major weakness while unarmed — flails slowly and loses summoning.

Immobile during “echo pulse” — a war-horn gesture that warns of incoming waves.


Notes:

The banner burns with no fuel. Some say it’s stitched from names, not cloth — those who died without cause. If you steal the banner and burn it in the right shrine, you can hear their final war song… or silence. Both are mercy.
