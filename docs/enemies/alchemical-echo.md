Lore Entry: Fragment from “Notes of the Hollow Crucible,” scribbled in ash by the Caput Mortuum Ascetic> “We were so close. Gold, perhaps. Or memory without pain. Or simply an end that didn’t unravel.”



> “The Alchemical Echo is not a monster. It is a sentence interrupted. A retort left boiling too long. It speaks in unfinished incantations and dreams in half-bonded reactions.”



> “Do not listen to it. Do not touch its trail. And above all, do not pity it. What it wants... is to finish becoming.”

Bestiary Entry

Name: Alchemical Echo
Type: Aberrant Alchemical Remnant
Threat Level: ⚠️⚠️ High – Unpredictable, Reality-Distorting
First Emerged: Post-Shattering – Collapse of Auralith’s Outer Crucibles

Description:
A twitching form suspended in semi-liquid transmutation — limbs and organs flicker between solid metals, crystalline growths, and bubbling compounds. Its voice shifts between arcane formulae and broken screams.

Hue Interaction:

Caput Mortuum Phylactery stabilizes it briefly, allowing safe passage or conversation.

Violet-bound players can interpret its unstable illusions to decode trapped spells.

Cobalt-bound players may reflect its chemical pulses back at it with correct timing.


Behavior:

Wanders lab ruins and memory shrines, seeking raw components to complete itself.

Fires orbs of unstable potion energy that inflict randomized status swaps (e.g., healing turns to damage, dodge becomes stumble).

May attempt to “fuse” with the player on low health — initiates a struggle event.


Known Weaknesses:

Highly susceptible to rhythm-based disruption or echo spells.

Stabilized briefly in areas touched by the Burnt Sienna Sculptor’s work.

Loud sounds (e.g., shattering glass or specific chants) disorient its progression.


Notes:
Some advanced alchemists can commune with the Echo using ancient elemental glyphs — though most who attempt it are either consumed… or remade. It is said one Echo remembers the face of the Ascetic — and weeps corrosive tears when it sees their sigil.
