    "name": "Hue Leeches",
    "type": "Color-Parasitic Aberration",
    "threat_level": "⚠️ Minor (but disruptive in swarms)",
    "first_emerged": "Post-Prism Fracture",
    "description": "Small, floating jellyfish-like creatures composed of liquefied, semi-transparent color.\n\nThey drift lazily until a hue is activated — then swarm to drain it from you.",
    "hue_interaction": "Target Active Hues: Prefer targets with recently activated spells or abilities.\n\nNeutral to physical presence, but highly reactive to visual spell cues or aura pulses.\n\nTurn gray and inert when exposed to complete hue-suppression fields (e.g., Nullshade auras or unaligned relics).",
    "behavior": "Spawn in swarms near prism fractures, old altars, or failed transmutation zones.\n\nLinger passively until provoked by hue use.\n\nAttempt to escape if stunned or flashed with high-contrast light bursts.",
    "weaknesses": "Area-of-effect bursts (especially of non-hue damage types, e.g., shockwaves, force spells).\n\nVulnerable to Prism Flash Talismans, which disrupt their hue tethering.\n\nCan be stunned with mirror-angled light, then popped like bubbles.",
    "notes": "Hue Leeches are not bound to one realm.\nThey are the drifting parasites of a broken system — showing up wherever color falters or bleeds.\n\nSome archivists believe they evolved from the Prism’s tears… others say they are what remains of unfinished hues — the ones never chosen."
