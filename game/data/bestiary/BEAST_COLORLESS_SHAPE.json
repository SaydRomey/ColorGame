    "threat_level": "ðŸ›‘ Critical (Pre-Final Boss Encounter)",
    "first_emerged": "Only in proximity to the Prism Wound, as hue balance fractures completely",
    "description": "A hollow, shifting humanoid made from semi-reflective voidglass. It walks like you. It fights like you. It dies like something that has already seen the ending.",
    "hue_interaction": "Copies your most-used hue abilities and traits â€” often in distorted forms.\n\nBecomes unpredictable when faced with contradictory or unstable hue alignments.\n\nNull-aligned players (colorless or hue-divided) may confuse it briefly.",
    "behavior": "Engages silently. No battle music plays until it takes damage.\n\nOpens with a mirrored version of your first ever learned spell or weapon.\n\nMimics your movement habits, attack rhythms, and even idle animations.\n\nIf you pause or hesitate, it does not â€” striking decisively.",
    "weaknesses": "Paradox spells (from Violet) or contradictory color combos cause it to flicker and destabilize.\n\nMemory Echo interactions may give you an extra dodge window or reveal a false opening.\n\nIf you unequip all hue bindings mid-fight, it loses structure briefly.",
    "notes": "Defeating it grants no loot â€” only stillness. The environment pauses for a beat. And something behind you exhales.\n\nIt is often mistaken as the final boss â€” but is instead the gatekeeper. The self before the choice."
