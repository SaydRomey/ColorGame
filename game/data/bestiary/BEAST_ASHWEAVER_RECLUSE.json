    "description": "A massive spider-like entity weaving threads of living ash. Its silk burns slowly, creating smoldering traps that linger in the environment.",
    "hue_interaction": "Drawn to Vermilion-bound players. Threads can ignite Hue Overload if fire-aspected color pools are too full.",
    "behavior": "Creeps near charred architecture. Lays slow-burning web paths. Lures players toward glowing husks to trigger ambushes.",
    "weaknesses": "Water-based or frost-attuned skills rapidly extinguish its threads. Susceptible to sudden gust-based spells.",
    "notes": "Many believe the Recluse nests within burnt memories. Webs sometimes shimmer with scenes of past ruins."
