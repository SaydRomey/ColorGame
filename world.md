# The wold

The world (let’s just call it The Realm for now) will be divided into six main biomes/regions, \
each aligned with a color family and designed to support its associated mood, gameplay mechanics, and faction culture.

🗺️ MAP STRUCTURE CONCEPT: “The Realm”

🔹 Design Philosophy

World shaped by the shattering of the Prismatic Core, with shards embedding themselves across the land.

Central hub: the Colorless Core (Nullshade) — the impact crater where the Core exploded.

Radiating outward: six major color biomes, each with distinct terrain, architecture, NPCs, hazards, and music.
